        "title": "Don’t forget the groundnut: What Nigeria may be missing in the race for protein innovation",
        "content": `In recent years, Black Soldier Fly (BSF) farming has captured the world’s attention, for mostly good reasons. BSF larvae transform organic waste into high-protein biomass that can replace fishmeal and soy in animal feed and is thus touted as the poster child of circular economy agriculture.I think that the buzz around the potential for BSF to contribute to food security and sustainable agriculture is justified. I have however, so far, not seen that ‘potential’ transform into tangible output at least in Nigeria. Tangible here means increased local feed availability and reduced feed costs (linked directly to BSF larvae) or scaled adoption of BSF-based feed products. I have been speaking with fish farmers for example and intend to publish a summary of my findings shortly. Many of them say, so far, while the theoretical and projected benefits of BSF farming sound convincing, these benefits have not yet materialized in practice. Based on these interviews, numerous field visits, and tons of research, I can confidently say that there are no actual, visible, or measurable results. 
I therefore think that if the goal is to achieve food security, or more to the point, improve nutrition and health outcomes, we should begin to constructively explore and consider other options.
One such option is Bambara groundnut (Vigna subterranea), a legume indigenous to many parts of Africa. It is currently mostly overlooked in research, development funding, and policy, but it has in the past shown great promise to contribute to climate smart agriculture. It is drought-tolerant, nitrogen-fixing, and according to available evidence, has an impressive nutrient profile. Locally, it is already consumed in foods like okpa, but its potential to be incorporated into animal feed has also been tested. 
Bambara groundnut has long been used in traditional African farming systems, where its haulms and seeds are fed to livestock. Empirical studies confirm its potential as a sustainable feed ingredient across various species including poultry, pigs, rabbits, and fish. When appropriately processed to reduce anti-nutritional factors (such as through heat treatment or fermentation) it can be incorporated into animal diets without compromising growth, nutrient utilization, or overall animal health.
In poultry, Bambara groundnut can replace up to 25–30% of soybean meal, while in pig diets, higher inclusion levels (up to 100%) have shown no adverse effects. In aquaculture, fermented and heat-treated Bambara meal has effectively substituted soybean meal in diets for Clarias gariepinus (African catfish), without any adverse impacts on growth and feed efficiency. 
So let’s run through a quick checklist: 
-Does Bambara groundnut offer valuable protein? Yes. Although,the protein quality of BSF larvae is far better (and higher) in terms of the amino acid profile and the digestibility is higher (since it is an animal dietary protein source), Bambara groundnut still provides protein levels worth exploiting in livestock feed. 
-Can it be cultivated sustainably, with minimal environmental impact? Absolutely. It is drought tolerant, contributes to nitrogen fixation, improves soil fertility, and supports climate-smart practices.
– Should we invest in its use as animal feed? I believe so.
My research, however, shows that while the crop has real potential, some deep-seated challenges remain. These include low yields, the presence of anti-nutritional compounds, insufficient processing infrastructure, and minimal research investment. 
That said, I think that at the very least, we should start talking about it. By ‘we’ I mean the research community in Nigeria, as well as anyone concerned about the cost of poultry, fish and beef.
Bambara groundnut may be better positioned than BSF to improve animal production outcomes for a variety of reasons. It is already embedded in local food cultures and economies. It thrives in low-input systems, has shown great potential to support smallholder farmers, and could arguably be more seamlessly integrated into food-feed models that reduce our reliance on increasingly vulnerable imports like soybean. I spoke with at least 15 farmers, and nearly all had heard of Bambara groundnut. Some recalled past workshops and initiatives, but said the trials mostly failed and were eventually abandoned.
To be clear, this is not a call to pit BSF against Bambara groundnut. The question isn’t whether one is better than the other. The former is rightly celebrated for its waste valorization capacities and feed conversion efficiency. But a future built on BSF alone (or any single “miracle” innovation) risks replicating the same narrow thinking that brought us monocultures, soy dependency, and fragile supply chains. In any case, so far, BSF has not really translated into any gains (I am repeating myself here, but this point cannot be overemphasised) and so I think we should begin to consider other alternatives. 
For one, a more diverse food systems innovation landscape, is very unlikely to hurt. The goal here is not novelty, but achieving food security. 
I am open to other ideas, but I think we could begin by investing in:
•	Research to improve the digestibility and amino acid profile of Bambara groundnut for feed use,
•	Processing innovations such as fermentation or extrusion to reduce anti-nutritional factors,
•	Breeding programs to increase yield and shorten cooking time,
•	And inclusive value chains that empower local farmers, particularly women, who are often the primary cultivators.
I also do not think that this conversation should end with Bambara groundnut. I think we should make room to explore all viable, climate-resilient alternatives for diversifying protein sources in animal feed systems.

        "content": `Why Nigeria Must Become a Land of Opportunities
I have in recent time grown to keep my political views to myself. At some point, especially around 2022 or so, I bickered with too many of my friends over politics and I regret some of the interactions. I also think the issue is that I am getting old. I am still young, but I am older than I used to be (obvious) and just do not care too much about these things any longer.
I however could not resist the urge to share this with Nigerians who do not listen to ‘Today in Focus’. I was a huge fan of Anushka Astana on that show. I loved the way she presented it and used to listen every weekday. Sometimes it was presented by Racheal Humphreys and I loved her too, but Anushka Astana had a particular flavor that made the show several magnitudes better. She left the show and I stopped listening for a time. Somehow, probably in part due to nostalgia, I returned to listening to it. Amongst many other things, listening to Today in Focus is linked to memories of my time in Brasil, which is possibly part of the best time of my life so far. Anyhow, ‘Today in Focus’ is the only politics podcast I used to listen to then, that I still listen to now. It can be very left- too left- sometimes, but I love it.
Regardless of what you love or don’t love, I recommend (highly so) that you listen to the Friday, November 22, 2024 episode here. If you are Nigerian, please do.  
I’d skip the part where I dissect the implications of the findings discussed in that episode. Maybe its due to age, maybe I am just lazy and uninterested, bear with me please.
In another five years, please do not say things like ‘where did Farage come from?’ Some of you haven’t stopped whining about where Trump came from, and it’s annoying. I have in the past made the argument that our pervasive inability to develop is driving political preferences and movements in the western world I’d tell you something, those media outlets that cozy up to you, are deceiving you. Recent political happenings is what democracy is all about. Its not an aberration, Its not strange or unusual, its not necessarily an indication that supporters of Politician X are bigots, its just democracy. I do not think you are averse to or harbor contempt for democracy now, do you?
Those of you (Nigerians) who continue to express distaste at Trump’s popularity are but loony Tunes, deceiving yourselves.
Listen to the show here, please and be sure about the following, so that you do not text me to chat about it any time, now and or in the future. Understand my position on key aspects of the show. To be sure, in the event that you strike a conversation with me regarding this matter in future, I will simply share this blog post with you. I won’t repeat myself. I am too old for that now.
1- The student who expresses concerns about immigrants and immigration (including you all and me) in his country? I am with him. As simple as that. Its his country, he says there’s too many of us there now, and well, yeah, he has the right to feel the way he feels. You also probably have a right to challenge or critique his opinion, but I’d say channel your energies elsewhere? E.g., into developing your own country so you and your descendants do not necessarily or desperately have to relocate to his own country?
2- There is nothing offensive about his comment on ‘native’ people.
3- The immigrant from Latvia? Hahaha. Ah tells me something about skin color, but look, why do we not want to work to fix our own country? Just why? By the way, this isn’t my opinion about the Latvian immigrant’s comment. I decided to keep that to myself. Ahem.
I know some of you will read this and not engage with the show. That’s fine. However, if you see me in another five years, please do not talk to me about Nigel Farage, regardless of the state of affairs at that time and how you feel about the state of affairs at that time. Though unlikely, but if what you choose to talk about is his grassroots appeal, or the fact that he is a great communicator, etcetera, let me clarify that I am open to that discussion. If you are going to complain about how someone you consider polarizing is leading a great Country (C), I am impervious to that. This seems simple, let’s agree to disagree. Thank you in advance.
Many of you (millennials) have children, some of you, up to four – never mind that some of you have the guts to lecture me about my meat consumption habits- even though you have four children, but I digress, as I tend to do many times. Some of you have four children, which is good, I really mean that, but you do not seem to worry about whether or not they will be able to live with dignity in future.
Do you play Whitney Houston’s song Greatest Love of All” –here in the car or at home? Do you encourage your children to strive for those ideals? The ideals Houston is passionately and artfully communicating in that brilliant rendition. ‘They can’t take away my dignity?’ Ah if you teach your children that while Nigeria is in such a mess, they somehow adequately equipped to handle bullying or social rejection without losing their sense of self, you are misleading them.
You see, as the jappa generation, there will be too many oppourtunites for their dignity to be taken from them or at least diminished. They won’t be able to refute and bash down all of those oppourtnities. You can disagree with me all you want, in the appropriate depths of your soul, you know what I am saying is true. You have grappled with those very challenges yourselves. I do not think you like it very much. You can still send a message to agree with, or refute this moral questioning. If however, you begin your discourse with derogatory terms like ‘stupid girl’, or ‘bitch’, I will not respond to you.
You should start thinking about that brilliant podcast and associated happenings rather than just ‘jappa, jappa, jappa’. What you think about is however up to you, just don’t criticise Trump, Farage et al., when you see me. It would annoy me. I would say something scathing and then you will say ahh look what she said, she is such a xxxxx. I advice you in advance, avoid broaching that subject with me please.
Immigration is shaping and will significantly shape global politics in the near future. Don’t act like the signs are not there. Don’t be a hypocrite.

        "title": "Celebrating World Biodiversity Day 2024 in Nigeria: Preserving Nature’s Diversity for a Sustainable Future",
        "content": `As we mark World Biodiversity Day in 2024, I thought we could take a moment to reflect on the importance of preserving our natural heritage and diverse ecosystems.
Biodiversity is important for sustaining life on Earth. It provides life with essential resources, from food and medicine to clean water and air. It plays a critical role in climate regulation and resilience against environmental changes. In Nigeria, many communities rely on traditional knowledge of plants and animals for their daily needs and biodiversity is thus intertwined with our cultural heritage and livelihoods.
Why celebrate World Biodiversity Day in Nigeria?
Nigeria is home to a wide variety of ecosystems, each teeming with unique species of flora and fauna. This year’s theme, “From Agreement to Action: Build Back Biodiversity,” resonates deeply because although Nigeria has made several (one might say) meaningless commitments, the Country is grappling with significant environmental challenges such as deforestation, desertification, and pollution.
Main threats to biodiversity in Nigeria
Despite its importance, Nigeria’s biodiversity faces significant threats. Deforestation, driven by agricultural expansion and illegal logging, is a severe risk to our forests. Poaching and wildlife trafficking is another threat that endangers our unique species. Climate change further exacerbates all relevant challenges, altering habitats and exerting additional pressure on ecosystems.
Like many others, I have written in the past about the degradation of the Niger Delta https://daraalegbeleye.com/the-niger-delta-a-prescription-for-restorative-justice/. The Niger Delta is one of the largest wetland and coastal ecosystems in Africa. It spans over 70,000 square kilometers and is characterized by a complex network of rivers, mangroves, swamps, and forests Ecological features of the Niger Delta – view here. It has the largest mangrove forest in Africa and the third largest in the world. These mangroves are crucial for coastal protection, carbon sequestration, and other vital ecological functions.
Biodiversity in the delta supports fisheries, agriculture, and tourism, which are vital for the local and national economy. The delta’s waterways are home to numerous species of fish, crustaceans, and mollusks, many of which are vital for local fisheries and global biodiversity. The region supports a range of wildlife, including the endangered West African manatee, the African fish eagle, and various primates. Plant life in the delta includes unique species that provide habitat and food for wildlife, as well as resources for local communities.
It has been several years since the death of activists such as Ken Saro Wiwa who in the very early years started to raise awareness of the ecological and environmental disasters that oil pollution, deforestation and overfishing in the Niger Delta could cause https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/press-release/2015/11/human-face-oil-pollution-niger-delta/.  
After all this time, amongst other challenges, many people in the region still do not have sustainable access to safe drinking water. Since this article is not about the decimation of the Niger Delta, but rather about preserving our natural ecosystems, I want to emphasize that the reference to the Niger Delta is but a reminder that we have a lot of work to do as a people.
A look at relevant initiatives and actions
Nigeria has committed to various international environmental agreements. For example, Nigeria is a signatory to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), purporting our global commitment. I however, do not think that these initiatives or showmanship adequately address the grave threats to biodiversity in our Country. These commitments and agreements must translate into real-world conservation efforts, otherwise, we are at risk as a people.
How you can get involved
Most ordinary citizens can contribute to preserving Nigeria’s biodiversity. Here are a few ways you can contribute:
•	Support conservation efforts: Donate to or volunteer with organizations dedicated to wildlife and habitat conservation.
•	Raise awareness: Educate others about the importance of biodiversity and the challenges it faces.
•	Participate in citizen science: Join projects that monitor local wildlife and habitats, contributing valuable data for conservation efforts.
We have a collective responsibility to ensure that our rich biodiversity thrives for future generations. We should work together to build back better and safeguard the intricate web of life that sustains us all.`,

        "title": "Perilous Proximity: Why Gas Stations Near Nigerian Homes Spell Trouble",
        "content": `Living in close proximity to fuel facilities such as petrol stations is risky Scientific American. Filling stations are inherently hazardous environments as highly flammable, volatile substances such as gasoline, diesel, and other fuels are stored and dispensed at filling stations.
When situated near residential areas, these risks are exacerbated, posing threats of explosions, fires, and environmental contamination. The consequences can be catastrophic, endangering lives and property.
Our government is aware of the dangers associated with siting petrol stations near residential areas but overlook them, nonetheless. Some people say ‘oh the government can’t do much at this point’, but I disagree.
The problem is indeed multifaceted and tough to navigate as it is due to factors such as failures in urban planning, other entrenched socio-economic problems, but also (and I stand firmly by this), lax regulation.
Poor urban planning and zoning regulations created the haphazard, sloppy arrangement of placing filling stations near residential communities. As is the case in many developing countries, urban planning and land use management in Nigeria is very poor. Rapid, uncontrolled urbanization, informal settlements, and inadequate zoning regulations means that petrol stations have over time being located in unsuitable areas. This is the argument of most proponents of the idea that this problem is not government’s fault. I consider the argument valid, even reasonable, but I still believe we should hold the government accountable.
I would not opine today on the socio-eoconomic factors that contributed to or continue to drive this problem. Nowadays, -and I am being honest here-, I do not have the mental strength to discuss these deep-seated, heart-rending socio-economic issues. I have grown weary of talking about them. I’d ask that you pardon me but be reminded that these issues are there and they are real and actual human beings are suffering.
So let us jump to the cracks in regulation and the subject matter this time.
Owners of filling stations may prioritize convenience and profit over safety, opting to establish stations in densely populated areas. That tendency is however not peculiar to Nigeria. In most cases and jurisdictions, if individuals and corporations can get away with wrongdoing, they will act lawlessly. Weak enforcement of safety standards and regulations by relevant authorities allows filling stations to operate near homes with minimal oversight and zero repercussions. Political corruption also contributes significantly to the problem. It is well known that political heavyweights routinely circumvent regulations and endanger public safety in Nigeria.
So I made my point. This problem is largely due to government negligence and ineptide.
Communities living in the vicinity of filling stations are vulnerable to risks. In the event of accidents, they are disproportionately affected, with loss of lives, injuries, displacement, and property damage being common outcomes. Fuel stations emit pollutants that can have detrimental effects on human health and ecosystems, potentially leading to health issues such as respiratory problems, skin irritations, and so on.
Relevant actors should not continue to ignore these risks. Regulatory authorities in Nigeria should implement and enforce strict guidelines on the siting of petrol stations. Wherever possible, filling stations can be relocated to designated industrial zones away from residential areas to mitigate risks and safeguard public safety. Moving forward though, minimum distance requirements between fuel facilities and residential areas should be established and enforced.
It is also good to work to quantify current threats to the quality of life for residents. Associated risks go beyond fire outbreaks and should be quantitatively explored. Communities should be empowered with knowledge about the risks associated with living near filling stations, and it is therefore important to foster advocacy for safer urban environments. In general, urban planning efforts should prioritize safety and environmental protection.
Two of my regular editors sent me feedback along the lines of: your heart does not seem to be in this at all. They are right. I wrote this because I consider it relevant, but the entire time could not stop asking myself how ridiculous this behavior is. Who sites petrol stations in some of the positions they are in currently? And in cities that are governed by human beings that at least have a head? It would seem they have a brain-. I think so, but they do not act it. These thoughts distracted me throughout.
Since I think everything I outlined in this article is painfully obvious, the short version of this article follows in the subsequent sentence. What is this gamble with lives and livelihoods? why is it so hard for us to prioritize safety, enact strong regulations, and implement sustainable solutions? https://daraalegbeleye.com/breakdown-of-law-and-order-is-a-threat-to-human-life-in-nigeria/

        "title": "Why Plantain, a Nigerian staple costs a fortune",
        "content": `Plantain, a versatile fruit that can be consumed at various stages of ripeness and can serve diverse culinary uses is a delicacy in many parts of Nigeria.
It tends to be prolific, yielding significant amount of fruit per plant. At any given time, depending on factors such as variety/cultivar, soil conditions and management practices, a single plantain tree can produce several hands of fruit during its growing season.
Plantain grows rapidly and vigorously particularly in the tropics, where the tree initiates fruiting within two years of planting. It is perennial and can produce fruit multiple times throughout its lifespan. To a great extent, there is thus, no need for yearly or periodic replanting.
Although an individual pseudostem of a plantain tree fruits only once, the plant as a whole can continue to produce fruit through its offshoots. The trees can produce offshoots or suckers that can grow into new plants and eventually bear fruit themselves. This attribute contributes significantly to its productivity, because once established, the tree can with proper management, continue to produce fruit for some time.
Furthermore, it is highly adaptable to environmental conditions including varying soil types and climatic conditions. Compared to other crops, it is also relatively resilient and according to some research can even tolerate some degree of drought.
Plantain is rich in essential nutrients including vitamins A and C, dietary fiber, and potassium. It is also an economically important crop serving as a source of income for many and furnishing other purposes including as feed for livestock.
So, imagine my surprise when a recent plantain purchase in Ibadan sent my jaw straight to the floor. 
I was beyond shocked when the trader quoted 2,500 naira for- maybe- 4 fingers of plantain. I asked her in Yoruba: se ogun n sele ni? which translates roughly to ‘is this (Nigeria) a war zone?’ She gave me a truly distasteful look and I was remorseful. This experience however bothered me and ignited interest in understanding why a fruit that I always thought had great potential to mitigate food insecurity in Nigeria was that expensive.
I have since spoken to many experts including the erudite Prof. Aiyelaagbe, who graciously shared his wealth of experience on this subject matter.
Amongst other things, he told me that low yield is due to poor investments by national government in genetic improvement and agronomy of the crop. High post-harvest losses due to poor/ inappropriate transportation means, as well as high demand due in part, to increase in population also contribute to the problem.
Prof. Aiyelaagbe proposes some solutions to make plantain more accessible. Some of these include the need to promote value addition, increase investment in genetic engineering, explore approaches that promote all-year-round production, and diversify utilisation base.
Advances in crossbreeding and genetics such as introgressing host plant resistance to various pathogens and pests, has led to the development of high-yielding cultivars with improved resistance to diseases and pests in other parts of the world.
In spite of extensive research so far, some questions persist for me, and I ask that you, dear reader oblige me. If we love plantain that much, why are we still cultivating and managing this crop using archaic techniques and approaches?
Who should fund the research into the development of resistant cultivars and in general, optimisation of approaches that can boost plantain productivity? Do we have the expertise to explore and optimise these approaches?
Can advancements in breeding techniques optimised elsewhere be transferred to the Nigerian plantain farming situation? What can we do to make plantain cultivation more productive?
Please write to me using the headline ‘dodo’ with suggestions and comments.

        "title": "The potential for musical tourism in Lagos state",
        "content": "For all its woes and doom, Nigeria is excelling at one thing: entertainment.\nThe music industry in particular has evolved into a global phenomenon, with people all around the world grooving to Nigerian songs. For whatever reason, Nigerian songs have gained widespread popularity globally.\nA few years ago, I was returning to Sao Paulo after a friend’s wedding and got talking with a man who was (maybe a little too excited) to hear that I am Nigerian. An apparent globe trotter, he told me going to a Lagos club was on his bucket list.\nUnfortunately, I did not have any good recommendations for him, but the fact that a British 50-something-year-old man wanted to go to a Lagos club piqued my interest. I thought (and I hope he never reads this), he was a little too old to be partying like that but prior to conversing with this man, I did not think Lagos was a potential point of interest. Before saying goodbye to him, I tried to sound as genuine as possible when I asked why he wanted to go to Lagos.\nSuch questions rarely elicit concise answers and that is one thing I am sure I will remember about this co-traveller for a long time. He told me quite simply: all the great party songs come from Lagos. I countered that by saying something like ‘oh, but the Musicians go on tours, entertain at concerts and so on, you could just attend a concert in a city near you’. He told me: the experience is likely to be different. There must be something about a place that generates such great beats. I doubt that honestly, but I started to research about it, and my research took me to YouTube where I spent hours reading comments on Nigerian music videos by people from all around the world.\nI must admit that I experienced a fleeting moment of pride to be a Nigerian. Some of the songs are per my tastes and preferences, terrible, but I liked some and put them on my phone. In case you care, I listen to Nigerian party songs, but I am too old and too busy now and so, I mostly operate by name/brand. For example, I am a Wande Coal fan and so if there is a Wande Coal song out, since it is by Wande Coal, I’d get it on to my phone (hehe).\nAnyhow, shortly after my preliminary research, I set up a quick survey. I wanted to know how many foreigners were even remotely enthusiastic first about Nigerian songs and how many would under whatever circumstances visit Nigeria, especially a Nigerian club.\nThe sample group for that survey was admittedly narrow, but the feedback the survey generated astounded me. My acquaintances, friends, colleagues and associates from the United Kingdom, South Africa, Namibia, Brazil, Columbia, Peru, the United States and other places not only enjoyed Nigerian music, many of them indicated they wouldn’t mind visiting Nigeria someday. I modified the survey to include that respondents identify a deterrent or potential deterrent. Many people who participated in the survey indicated that insecurity was one major consideration or reason why they would not go to Nigeria.\nInsecurity is undoubtedly one of Nigeria’s most significant challenges, but it isn’t sufficient justification or excuse for what I perceive to be yet another missed opportunity. It is not lost on me, that as is usually the case, Nigeria is failing at transforming potential into tangible dividends. In this case, it appears that we have the product, but cannot commercialize it.\nLagos is Nigeria’s most vibrant city, and it turns out that as the British man told me, many of the world’s coolest party songs indeed come from Lagos. Many of the people I have since spoken to about this also seem to think Lagos (or Nigerian) clubs may indeed offer some spectacular or unique ambience. I also hear that many of the big musicians entertain at some of these clubs and that is likely a bonus.\nThere are however, good reasons why potential visitors are not flocking to Lagos clubs for entertainment, holidays or whatever you want to call it. While I cannot tell what all potential tourists expect if they go to Lagos, and I should by all means, trace the relics of that survey, build on it and conduct a more comprehensive assessment, Nigerian music seems to be one force that people gravitate towards and Lagos has that to offer. There is also a range (albeit narrow) of potential recreational activities that can complement music for tourists and so in this article, I want to highlight what Lagos can do to commercialize her entertainment flavor.\nLagos already possesses some features or traits that can furnish tourism goals. There are a variety of attractions such as historical sites, museums, art galleries, theatres, and cultural landmarks that may appeal to some tourists. Lagos also has a vibrant nightlife with bars, clubs, and live music venues.\nInfrastructure is however, very poor and the managers of the city, if they want to make Lagos into a tourism hub need to invest in transportation facilities, accommodation options and tourist services such as tour operators, guides, and information centers. Safety and security is crucial for tourism and must be prioritised. Lagos is comparatively rich, and I think with ambitious leadership, relevant authorities can create inviolable security status for the state where irrespective of the goings-on in other parts, Lagos is fortified and impervious to security threats and risks.\nCity managers should work to create a safe and secure environment for tourists with effective law enforcement, other tangible security measures, low crime rates and reliable emergency services. Well-lit streets and pedestrian-friendly areas can go a long way in making tourists feel comfortable and as relevant, should be addressed. It is also vital to make safety provisions for diverse audiences, including travelers with disabilities, families with children, and senior citizens. I have observed that we tend to neglect this demographic, so I want to emphasize here that tourism efforts should remember to cater to this group. To be sure, I am not saying that life and property in other parts of Nigeria do not matter, I am saying that Lagos has great potential to attract tourists and one way to embark on our long journey to sustainable development could be to optimally exploit this potential.\nSome people disagree with me on this, and while I admit that some parts of Lagos can be unpleasant, I think the locals are welcoming and friendly. It is however, important to cultivate an uncompromising service-oriented culture because like in many parts of Africa, service delivery is frustratingly poor in Lagos. A diverse culinary scene with local specialties, international cuisine, street food, and dining options for different budgets can boost the overall tourism experience and should be cultivated. Food markets, food tours, and culinary events showcasing local flavors and traditions are not very common in Lagos but are a potentially viable idea to boost tourism.\nWho benefits from successfully establishing Lagos as a hub for tourism? All Nigerians. Tourism can contribute to the economic growth of Lagos and cultural exchange. After fulfilling due diligence to ensure that the city can be a tourism hub, effective marketing strategies and collaborations with relevant stakeholders such as travel agencies can help promote the city as a desirable tourist destination.",

        "title": "What is required to tackle cervical cancer in Nigeria?",
        "content": "Cervical cancer is the second most prevalent form of cancer among women in Nigeria, trailing only breast cancer.\nAccording to some estimates, 14, 943 new cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed yearly in the country and at least 10, 403 deaths are attributed to the disease yearly. These likely conservative statistics underscore the urgent need for efficient strategies to combat cervical cancer in Nigeria.\nMedical research has identified risk factors including persistent infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) strains. Other risk factors include poor access to preventive healthcare services, limited awareness, socioeconomic factors, and cultural barriers that may make it difficult to constructively and objectively navigate women’s reproductive health in some parts of the country. Women in rural areas may grapple with peculiar barriers such as long distances to healthcare facilities and financial constraints. Infection with HIV/AIDs also reportedly amplifies risks.\nAlthough vaccines that prevent infection with certain high-risk HPV strains are available in Nigeria, vaccination rates are reportedly low. Factors that contribute to low vaccination rates include affordability, poor access, and limited awareness. Some cultural perceptions also contribute to low vaccination, as for example, young girls many of whom are sexually active at an early stage and could benefit from early immunization are for a variety of reasons unable to access vaccination. Poor access to other healthcare services including routine gynecological examinations and screenings also contributes to the mortality burden since late-stage diagnoses has been identified as a major risk for death or complications. Limited awareness and understanding of cervical cancer, its risk factors, and the importance of preventive measures contribute to late-stage diagnoses, but this can be addressed if appropriate action is taken. For example, comprehensive public health education campaigns can help dispel myths and promote early detection.\nThere are many potentially important aspects of the incidence, risks, and management of cervical cancer in the Nigerian context, but a critical assessment indicates that it is fundamentally important to develop targeted interventions and prevention strategies. To do so, it is crucial to correctly understand the factors or elements that contribute to the incidence of cervical cancer amongst Nigerian women.\nFirst, we are not even clear on the current morbidity and mortality burden for the disease. Again, it is easier to manage what is properly measured and data on current deaths and complications due to cervical cancer is highly desirable. Another thing is that although I am in the process of clarifying, it may be inaccurate to assume that research on a separate demographic of women is transferrable or applicable to Nigerian women. Properly tailored, context-specific research on risk factors and associated relevant factors for cervical cancer prevention and management is required.\nRecent studies on the prevalence of HPV strains among Nigerian women report that the most common types of HPV detected among sampled Nigerian women were HPV71 (17%), HPV82, HPV16, HPV6 and HPV201. The study also detected a diverse group of 25 HPV types including HPV types 91, 114, 118, 152 and 196. Some strains such as HPV types 16 and 18 are more high risk or more strongly associated with the development of cervical cancer and it is good that more studies monitor the prevalent HPV types being transmitted among women in Nigeria. It is also important to explore and begin to characterise the main factors that contribute to delayed medical intervention amongst women. It is important to make routine screening programs more available and accessible. It is also important to tackle cultural beliefs and practices that can influence women’s health-seeking behaviours, as well as cultural norms that hinder open, constructive conversations about gynecological concerns and sexual health overall.\nOver the next several weeks, I would be asking gynecologists and other health experts specific questions. Some current ideas include: Do we have an efficient national screening program? Are current efforts for education about cervical cancer useful/adequate? What are the essential components of a comprehensive strategy to combat cervical cancer in Nigeria? What are the factors responsible for, or that contribute to late detection of cervical cancer? Other questions may likely arise, but overall, I expect that questions would revolve around vaccination rates and programs, access to screening services, as well as education and training.\nCervical cancer is one of Nigeria’s foremost public health concerns and it demands immediate well-coordinated action. By prioritizing awareness, prevention, and early detection, it is possible to minimize the burden of cervical cancer among Nigerian women.\nReference:\n1.\thttps://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-023-02106-y",

        "title": "The need to make Lagos better prepared for climate change",
        "content": "Climate change impacts are already evident in Lagos, but if left unmanaged or unchecked, more adverse impacts on various aspects of society in Lagos can be expected. Due to its low-lying coastal geography, uncontrolled urbanization, and poor infrastructure, Lagos is highly vulnerable to flooding. Climate change can through for example, more frequent and intense rainfall events, amplify Lagos state’s susceptibility to flooding, potentially leading to loss of life and property. Flooding can contaminate water resources, but changes in precipitation patterns can contribute to or create threats to water safety and security, and thus increase the risks of food and waterborne illnesses. Other direct health risks such as but not only increased transmission of vector-borne diseases like malaria may arise from higher temperatures, heatwaves and other extreme weather events associated with climate change. Though currently poorly quantified, rising sea levels, coastal erosion and even flooding is contributing to displacement of communities, disruption of industrial activities, agriculture, fisheries, transportation, and tourism, as well as damage to infrastructure and other critical assets located along the coastline, creating and or exaggerating economic challenges for affected populations. Climate change can stress existing infrastructure such as roads, bridges, drainage systems and utilities, which can in turn, potentially aggravate the impacts of extreme weather events. Increased temperatures can also lead to higher energy demands for cooling systems, exerting strain on an already overwhelmed power supply infrastructure. Lagos is one of the fastest-growing cities in the world, but like many other Nigerian cities, it has been poorly managed over the last several years creating a near-crisis situation. The city grapples with challenges such as inadequate housing-, which has given rise to extensive informal settlements and urban sprawl-, lack of basic services, entrenched infrastructural deficits and substandard living conditions. To mitigate or manage climate-related challenges in Lagos state, city managers must adequately understand and interact with these fundamental city-administration challenges. A set of focused action plans that lead to improved urban planning, sustainable infrastructure development, enhanced disaster preparedness and response, efficient water resource management, and community engagement can better position Lagos to mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change. Urban planning and city management strategies must therefore, forthwith, prioritize climate resilience and sustainable development. Lagos needs effective management that can enforce regulations that deter uncontrolled, spurious settlement, especially in vulnerable areas such as coastal zones and floodplains. Other land use regulations and building guidelines/codes that consider climate risks and promote resilient construction practices across relevant sectors such as construction, coastal development, land use, and disaster management are also required. Flood risk management is a priority, and it is important to upgrade, expand and maintain drainage systems to improve water flow and reduce the risk of urban flooding, especially in flood-prone areas. To protect vulnerable coastal and low-lying areas from sea-level rise and storm surges, and overall, enhance resilience against flooding, it is also vital to construct and maintain flood defences, such as barriers and embankments. Managers of the city can consider retrofitting existing infrastructure and buildings to be more resilient or better withstand extreme weather events such as floods and storms, but new buildings and critical infrastructure should be constructed using climate-resilient, sustainable designs and materials to withstand extreme weather events. Investment in green infrastructure and ecosystem restoration are likely to yield robust environmental and public health benefits and should be pursued. For example, ecosystems like mangroves, wetlands, and coastal vegetation can act as buffers against flooding, erosion, and storm impacts and as relevant, should be restored and preserved. Green infrastructure solutions such as the creation of urban green spaces, green roofs, permeable pavements and so on, can amongst other benefits minimize surface runoff and should also be explored. Water conservation is integral to enhancing climate resilience, therefore, policies and other relevant efforts that contribute to efficient, responsible use of water, groundwater recharge, as well as protection of freshwater sources should be designed and implemented. Amongst other sustainable water resources management practices, water recycling, rainwater harvesting, optimization and adaptation of efficient irrigation technologies are some relevant practical approaches. Similarly, efficient waste management can foster a more sustainable and resilient city, and it is thus important to implement and sustain effective waste management strategies. Also, investing in and expanding access to renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power can minimize dependence on central, (weak) energy grid in the city, contribute to mitigating climate change impacts, particularly long term, and can deliver multiple public health, economic and sustainable development benefits for Lagos and its residents. Government should, therefore, create better access to renewable energy sources in the city. It is important to establish and maintain efficient early warning systems to alert and provide information to residents regarding impending extreme weather events. Government should however, facilitate not only preparedness, but timely evacuation and adaptation. Climate adaptation and resilience action plans should be incorporated into development strategies and policies across relevant sectors in the state, but it is important to develop and implement climate resilient regulations, policies, and action plans at local levels. Awareness campaigns, training programs and other capacity-building initiatives to contribute to resilience at the grassroots level should be considered. It is also vital to empower community leaders and other local authorities to efficiently respond to and manage climate related emergencies. Finally, government must invest in research, innovation, and technology to develop or update climate resilient solutions and practices tailored specifically to address Lagos states’s climate challenges. Government and relevant stakeholders should act to strengthen data collection, monitoring and analysis systems to inform decision making. Contemporary, relevant risk assessment surveys and vulnerability analysis to characterise, identify and improve understanding of climate-related hazards and their potential impacts on communities and infrastructure are some relevant research needs. Overall, useful strategies should be implemented decisively, cohesively, and efficiently to minimise vulnerabilities, build resilience against the impacts of climate change and generally, better equip Lagos to cope with climate-related challenges.",

        "title": "Cost of livestock feed is an immediate, critical threat to food security in Nigeria",
        "content": "As of December 2022, a crate of eggs in Lagos, Nigeria sold for about 1,600 Naira depending on factors such as the location, size, type, and quality of eggs. By December 2023, the price had increased by over 50% to up to 3,500 Naira. Prices are higher, but availability is also a problem. By the end of December 2023, many residents were virtually scrambling to buy eggs. A retailer told me that she must beg or lobby farmers to supply her shop. Many other people have described challenges in finding eggs to buy, with some recounting physical or virtual queues, repeated calls to suppliers, and other inconveniences. Farmers are stressed, and previously healthy relationships are strained due to higher prices. Someone told me that when she asked her longtime egg supplier why she was now selling a crate for 2,600 Naira, the supplier snapped and impatiently asked her whether or not she was willing to buy.\n\nI tried to understand how eggs became so expensive in Ibadan and every relevant actor I spoke to told me ‘It’s the cost of feed’. I hear that chicken meat is also costly due to a great extent, to the cost of chicken feed. Other livestock sectors including fish and pig farming are equally affected and from all indications, the situation is the same or similar in most Nigerian cities.\n\nAlthough multiple factors typically interact to influence or dictate the price of food, the high cost of livestock feed is significantly impacting livestock production expenses in Nigeria. Nigerian livestock farmers customarily use feed constituted of fish meal (as a source of protein), vitamins, mineral premixes, and essential amino acids particularly lysine and methionine. Fluctuations in global prices for fish meal stimulated the use of cheaper alternatives such as plant-derived protein sources like soybean in livestock feed formulations. Due to factors such as insurgency, terror, and reckless urbanization where in some parts, former agricultural farming areas have been converted to residential estates, Nigeria no longer produces cereals (another integral constituent of most livestock feed) on a sustainable scale, forcing livestock farmers to import maize, wheat and other cereals from neighboring countries.\n\nFood insecurity is a well-described feature of the Nigerian situation, but there has been in recent times, a slow-burning, yet urgent increase in associated threats and risks. Owing to several factors including volatile exchange rates, high energy and transport costs and other logistical challenges along food production-supply chains, food, especially protein of animal origin has become very expensive in Nigeria. At this rate, in the next five to ten years, many more Nigerian citizens will have limited or little access to dietary animal protein sources, with potentially significant public health impacts.\n\nAlthough it is already belated, the government must act decisively to manage the crisis. The problem is multifaceted and complex, but there are certain strategies that if implemented properly, can contribute to assuring lower overall costs of production and possibly stabilize prices of eggs and other livestock products.\n\nAny number of challenges along the chain can singly or in combination contribute to high prices for animal-based food and a vital first step is thus to monitor and understand the factors contributing to high production costs so that policymakers and relevant stakeholders in the livestock industry can better manage the situation to ensure stable and affordable food prices for Nigerian consumers. Specifically, it is important to systematically determine the factors that contribute to high livestock feed costs and design tailor-made approaches to minimise the impact of these factors.\n\nRelevant authorities can encourage the use of local feed resources such as crop residues, agro-industrial by-products, legumes, and pasture. Fundamentally, it is important to invest in sustainable production of cereals dedicated to livestock feed production. More focused, targeted, and dedicated research into feed formulation and nutritional management is however required too. The government must support animal nutrition research to optimize feed formulations and feeding practices that ensure affordable and efficient utilization of available feed ingredients that produce feed that satisfies the nutritional requirements of livestock. Scaling is vital and it is important to ensure that research is taken beyond the shelf and applied to meaningfully contribute to food security. As feasible, government should implement targeted support schemes or subsidies to stimulate adoption of innovative techniques for feed manufacturing, equipment, and other relevant infrastructure. If implemented correctly and successfully, this can encourage sustainable feed production practices, but minimise the financial burden on farmers. Developing and utilizing well-balanced, high quality feed formulations can significantly reduce costs of production, but many different elements and factors influence operational costs and the final prices of agricultural commodities. It is thus important to optimise every step along livestock production-retail chain. Overall, escalating cost of livestock feed represents an immediate and critical threat to food security in Nigeria and must be taken seriously.",

        "title": "Corruption cuts deep, consumes everything, even football glory.",
        "content": "A few years ago, in Sao Paulo, an artisan was in my apartment to fix a broken shower. He could tell that I am not Brazilian and asked where I am from. I’ll never forget the look of elation on his face when I told him I am Nigerian. He gleefully exclaimed J. J Okocha! and proceeded to express the unrivaled joy he felt watching Okocha and other talented, skillful Nigerian footballers play.\n\nI grew up in the 1990s in Nigeria with Ibrahim Babangida and Sani Abacha as Heads of state at different points and as you may imagine those were brutally difficult times. I was (and I am still) lucky to have truly loving parents, and read tons of nice books, but the 1990s was an otherwise grim period for most of us.\n\nNigeria however, used to have a rich football tradition that was a source of delight for an otherwise miserable population. Our Country was a dominant force in African football, winning the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) in 1980 and 1994, but also in 2013. The Nigerian national football team, known as the Super Eagles, achieved significant success on the international stage, having qualified for the World Cup severally and even reached the Round of 16 on multiple occasions. Football, which was deeply ingrained in Nigerian culture, was arguably the most popular sport at the time. I have never been a football fan, but I have vivid memories of football victory days that gave many of us something to be passionate and jubilant about.\n\nYet that joy which possibly helped many Nigerians cope, has also been snatched away from us.\n\nFor a long while after my encounter with the Brazilian in my apartment, I wondered what exactly went wrong and how all that football relevance vanished (or at least diminished significantly). Recently, I started to research this idea in my spare time, and the more I read about it, the more preoccupied with it I became. I have since read about corruption allegations, mismanagement, lukewarm investment in infrastructure, and overall poor administration by local and national football authorities. Indeed, there is a lot of corruption in the world, but apparently, nothing is sacrosanct to us where we say oh you know what, I just shouldn’t mismanage this. I’d get to this in a separate article in future, but I have read with utter dismay, about gross mismanagement of football infrastructure, including training facilities, stadiums, and grassroots development programs. At some point, I became furious wondering just how the individuals who were meant to be custodians of such delicate resources did not think of the potential implications that their flagrant disregard for ethics could have for not only maintaining a competitive edge, but nurturing talent.\n\nThe lost football glory may have broad, far-reaching implications for society and culture, which makes it imperative to explore opportunities for restoration. Many talented, internationally renowned football players emerged from Nigeria. Rashidi Yekini (who I think Nigeria could have treated a lot better), Jay-Jay Okocha (the artisan in my apartment in Sao Paulo is a huge fan), Kanu Nwankwo, and Sunday Oliseh are notable examples. As is the case in many other parts of the world, football stars often serve as role models for fans including young individuals, in many cases, influencing them positively. There are compelling stories of how some football stars through dedication and hard work achieved success. Such success stories can motivate others to work hard, pursue their dreams and purposefully navigate life’s challenges. The absence of such inspiration especially in a poor, -we could call it doomed country- can have consequences too. For example, these days, there is practically nothing to be enthusiastic about. Is it possible that this sour state of affairs contributes to why many young men and women are turning to drugs and other vices? It’s worth thinking about.\n\nDwindling football glory translates directly to a loss of other opportunities too. Many football stars leverage their fame and platform to advocate for social causes such as environmental issues, human rights, poverty alleviation, education, and health. Kanu Nwankwo, who himself had experienced a serious heart condition at some point, established a charitable organization: KHF dedicated to providing heart surgeries for underprivileged children with heart conditions in Nigeria. He has the resources and the inclination and has since contributed immensely to society. Influential figures can raise awareness about, and support many meaningful causes, and so, to my mind, it is important to not squander or misappropriate resources meant to support football talent. Also, the influence of football stars tends to extend to various industries or sects through commercial partnerships, sponsorships and endorsements including fashion, advertising, entertainment, and so on, contributing to economic growth and development.\n\nThe relevance of football to society transcends its status as a sport, in many cases impacting various aspects of society. It is obviously an important source of entertainment and recreation, but in our case, it played crucial roles in our cultural identity, fostered a sense of pride, promoted social interaction, and one could even argue that it contributed to social integration, fostering friendships and a sense of belonging in many communities. International football stars may also have contributed to representing the Nigerian culture on a global stage.\n\nWhat can be done to revive that football glory and relevance? My research on this did not afford me any meaningful insights probably because I was too annoyed to constructively process Nigerian-football related information. I have however spoken with many football fans, and I should clarify that the ideas and suggestions, I proffer here are not original.\n\nOne clear point emerges from my discussions with most people: it is vital to nurture young talent, but that requires robust youth development programs, academies and grassroot initiatives. Do we have what it takes to develop and manage that? This next point resonates with even me, a complete novice when it comes to football: a strong foundation is required for the national teams. What should be done in that case? Please send me suggestions and comments, and I’d publish them in a separate article. A thriving domestic league can offer a platform to showcase talent and it is thus important to revitalize domestic leagues to enhance competition standards and player exposure. Seasoned coaches can refine players’ skills, tactical understanding and overall, offer a competitive edge and I therefore, think there has to be some way to assure a pool of qualified, well-trained coaches. Can we objectively say that we have at any point(s) had seasoned coaches? And how can we breed good coaches? Evidently, it is vital to build and maintain infrastructure, and broad, sweeping, meaningful reforms in football administration are necessary (this goes without saying!). I must ask though, how can we ensure, or shall I even say enforce transparent effective administration in football governing bodies? Where should the money for football development initiatives come from? I raise this because some of the ardent football fans I have spoken to say ‘oh allocate adequate funding, secure sponsorships, and develop supportive policies’ – and I realise I previously highlighted some of the potential socio-economic benefits of a thriving national football element, but where should the resources come from? Please write to me with specific ideas on that. Are football icons serving as suitable role models for prospective young players? Do they have the responsibility to? And should there be programs or attempts to foster or provide mentorship programs for young players? And last, but by no means the least, is promotion of women’s football potentially relevant?",

        "title": "The global cocoa market is lucrative. Nigeria should not keep missing out on cocoa-related dividends.",
        "content": "Cocoa is one of Nigeria’s major non-oil export commodities contributing significantly to rural development, revenue earnings and overall socioeconomic development. Initially (starting from the 1870s) farmers in southwestern states such as Ondo, Ogun, Osun, and Oyo cultivated cocoa on a relatively small scale. Due in large part to visionary leadership by Obafemi Awolowo, a prominent Nigerian political leader, by the early 20th century, cocoa farming and processing had expanded and cocoa became a crucial export crop for Nigeria. We were for a while a major player in the global cocoa market but in spite of rich historical success and what seemed to be promising prospects for the cocoa sector, Nigeria’s relevance diminished, resulting in missed opportunities.\n\nIt is possible (maybe even likely) that climate change contributes to the decline, but it is also apparent that challenges such as poor access to credit facilities, agricultural inputs, and agricultural extension services have hindered farmers’ ability to improve and expand cocoa production. Pests and diseases are another potential influencing factor. It is also possible that price fluctuations and uncertainties in the global cocoa market contributes to the slip in Nigeria’s position in global rankings, but that though plausible, is an excuse for the Nigerian government and the so-called experts who manage the sector, and I am unwilling to indulge them today. Outlining and discussing Nigeria’s woes in any form or factors that have contributed to the prevalent woes make for a gloomy writing experience, and so, I will skip that part where the problems should be parsed and jump right into what I think we could do.\n\nI feel that first, thorough academic and industrial research documenting the trends in productivity decline and factors responsible for or that have contributed to the decline is desirable. I also believe that the Nigerian government can and should implement tangible policies and initiatives to support cocoa production and commerce. These initiatives should be designed to address specific challenges in the cocoa industry; one of many good reasons why it is important to properly understand the peculiar challenges the sector is experiencing. Other potentially relevant efforts to improve productivity may include research on disease-resistant cocoa varieties, provision of extension services and relevant programs such as those that can potentially enhance farmers’ access to required agricultural provisions and credit. Infrastructural development including agricultural machinery, transport and storage facilities, as well as processing technologies are also likely to be useful.\n\nI have read some place (or several places in fact), that government initiatives and programs have over time offered some of the above-mentioned facilities, but such pieces are likely written by sycophants hired to launder the government’s reputation and I think right-thinking Nigerians should ignore such narratives. We must ensure that creative people who can quantitively decide the relevance of cocoa productivity on Nigeria’s development agenda and implement relevant policies and programs to improve the competitiveness of Nigerian cocoa in the global market are appointed to manage the sector. Cocoa continues to be a valuable cash crop as it is used to produce chocolate and other confectionery. A thriving cocoa sector represents immense economic potential, and we should make the best of this lucrative market.\n\nSome of you are brilliant economists or agricultural specialists and I anticipate comments and suggestions from you.",

        "title": "Reason to despair",
        "content": "My generation has had it very rough. We inherited a country overrun by decades of military rule and untold corruption, and majority of us adapted to surviving under unrelenting socioeconomic strain, early on.\n\nOur economy, even at its finest, was always very bad. We have consistently had thoroughly incompetent leaders foisted on us through compromised, faulty electoral processes and continue to suffer the repercussions of years of extremely bad management decisions. Overwhelming structural imbalances that have stifled development and growth, produced distortions that suffused the polity with ethnic and religious conflicts have afflicted our society for so long, but my generation arguably suffered the brunt of it.\n\nThe hardship, our stark realities (which are even more dire now, in hindsight), never caused me to despair. Not even a little. I was always so enthusiastic; my middle name could very well have been ‘sunny optimism’. ENDSARS dampened that enthusiasm, but did not cause me to despair. But let me tell you why I have now grown extremely discouraged.\n\nI will never understand people who show total disregard for the quality of healthcare. They annoy me plenty. One of our political leaders, an intellectually inferior man with a macabre sense of humour, recently opined (and I am paraphrasing here): ‘Nigeria has done so much for doctors. Abroad, they have to pay for residency,’ and on….\n\nYou know, some of these people think that somehow, these types of things will not be historically relevant or consequential. They are wrong, as you cannot airbrush this sort of foolishness from history. History is not going to be kind towards them.\n\nThese days, I am much less prone to verbose prose, so here is the summary of this article: A country that trains doctors and allows them to leave to serve other countries is a doomed country. That country is NOT a country that is going to make it. The reason for despair, however, is more related to our attitude as citizens. The quote ‘A people deserve the leadership they get’ becomes more profound to me as the years roll by.\n\nI am utterly discouraged not because our leaders are haplessly driving us aground, but because there seems to be so many people (including my contemporaries) who mirror the views of the people dispossessing us as a country!\n\nIn a nutshell, if you are one of those people who do not appreciate the need to agitate for improved welfare for doctors, I want you to (1) realise that there is something very wrong with your reasoning. Please believe it, because it is the unbiased truth. (2) You are a big part of the problem we have as a country. (3) If you have the means, please work on changing your perspective. Thank you.\n\nCollectively, we must force the government to invest more (and when I say more, I mean substantively so) in healthcare. We don’t have much choice here: we must agitate for consistent and equitable government spending on health.\n\nCan we retain doctors? I think we can at least try? But I honestly intend to find out. In the next few weeks, I will conduct a poll assessing doctors’ opinions and preferences. What is most important to Nigerian-trained doctors? Financial renumeration? Career progression? Quality of postgraduate training? Better working conditions? If one or more of these are significantly improved, let’s try to find out what percentage of doctors will readily stay back and work in Nigeria! Based on our findings, we officially begin to task the government to do more, but with better focus.\n\nIt is important to clarify that not everyone who discredits doctors’ strike action(s) or other forms of agitation is disingenuous. Deep mistrust of elites and experts is rife, and some people are truly ignorant.\n\nI think Journalists (a group of Nigerians that I do not readily criticise), need to act accordingly. One of the most critical roles of journalism is to place these sorts of issues on the public agenda, facilitate healthy debates and educate those that are sceptical.\n\nPlease understand something: this isnt merely about doctors’ welfare, this is about developing healthcare/medical care capacity in Nigeria. Doctors and other healthcare workers are better suited to ensure that our health instituitons are run by bright, forward thinking individuals, not sloppy people who are fanatical about hegemonic methods and policies. In any case, you cannot seperate quality healthcare delivery from doctors’ welfare, really. All Nigerians must stand together to insist on improved healthcare. The fight will be more effective, if we unite and give this issue the priority it truly deserves. Our house is on fire. Literarily so and we are not doing anything to curb the fire.\n\nMy fellow compatriots, the thing that is coming is holding a stick and wearing a hat. There is still some sun up, to dry our clothes, but we must act now, before the sun totally sets. Our attitude must be that of a group of people intent on averting disaster.\n\nSend me one word that best describes what that attitude should be- se************@gm***.com\n\nThanks for spending part of your time with me, I’ll see you next time!",

I could make the effort to outline some of the woes of the current administration, but that will be a waste of my time.

Solar panels as used throughout this article refers to all other alternative sources of energy commonly used in Nigeria, except petrol/diesel generators. Generators are a well-established source of environmental pollution, and are indeed worth exploring, however, the focus here is solar panels, because amongst many other reasons, they have been lauded as environmentally friendly since they require minimal maintenance over their lifespan.\n\nAs things stand, I do not think we need to worry very much about the environmental or related impacts of producing solar panels. I may be wrong, but I am almost sure a significant percentage (if not all) solar panels currently in use in Nigeria were imported from somewhere.\n\nThat does not however, mean that things are honky dory and we can just go about our business. The mechanism for converting sunlight to electricity is immensely impressive and so far, most people who have installed solar panels are happy with their investment. While that’s great, we must prepare to handle the associated waste.\n\nThe lifespan for brand new, well designed, fully functional solar panels is according to many reports, around 25 – 30 years. However, many of the solar panels installed are not brand new, and some are not well designed. Some are Tokunbo- a colloquial term used to mean second-hand vehicles and other machinery imported from rich countries, which means that part of the half-life has already been exhausted. Therefore, some of those solar panels will need to be disposed of in the next few years. Some other people whose solar panels aren’t Tokunbo, but who started using the solar panels several years ago, will still need to replace their solar panels at some point in the future. So regardless of the longevity of your panels (realistic or embellished), at some point, it will become waste. Waste that must be properly managed, particularly because of the potential human and environmental health hazards. The lifespan of inverter batteries is even shorter (around 3 -4 years!), and some batteries are already lying around, constituting a major public health risk.\n\nAlready, Nigeria is a dumpsite for all manner of electronic waste. Refrigerators, washing machines, computers, name it. The environmental impact of dumping waste in Nigeria has not been adequately assessed, but going by what is physically observable at waste dump sites, the impact is tangible, with likely future impacts on human and ecological health. According to some estimates, solar energy associated hazardous waste, will exceed the waste that laptops, iPhones and other electronics constitute, in future.\n\nSince solar panels contain toxic materials including heavy metals such as lead, as they disintegrate, these toxic components can leach out and possibly reach groundwater and surface water resources. They might also reach agricultural soils and enter the food chain. Considering that waste is rarely properly managed in Nigeria, and solar panels may in fact, not be properly discarded in designated landfills (if there are indeed any designated landfills), then the potential for human exposure to aerosolized pollutants also exists. Trash pickers who scavenge through waste dumpsites by hand are possibly the most immediate risk group.\n\nSo, what should we do?\n\nThe jury seems to be split on the issue of recycling. Some of the reports I have read seem confident that solar panels can be recycled. I should clarify here, that the issue of whether or not solar panels can be recycled might be immaterial in our case, as I doubt we have the infrastructure to efficiently recycle anything much less fagged out, potentially toxic solar panels. There is another, quite persuasive school of thought however, that solar panels are either difficult to recycle or are just not worth it economically and in the eco-friendly sense. There are some other groups of experts such as the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) who have said that solar panels can be recycled, and that the process is well worth it.\n\nWe can prepare a recycling market for solar panels. Since use is increasing steadily, relevant stakeholders, social impact investors and other investors can start considering developing the capacity to recycle solar panels. Train personnel, invest in robust machinery, equipment and facilities, explore markets for trading the salvaged resources that are valuable. Start recycling!\n\nIt will create jobs and government revenue. It would also contribute to protecting our environment and improve public health. It is however, obvious that we must tackle insecurity in Nigeria. Noone will invest in a country as volatile as ours. It is clear that the issue of insecurity is complicated, but tackling insecurity is not the focus of this article.\n\nThe relevant arm of government must intervene and create minimum requirements and incentives, where necessary for disposing solar panels. We also need more stringent environmental protection laws, as well as a tighter regulatory premise to prevent other countries from mindlessly dumping half-dead solar panels and other forms of e-waste in Nigeria.",

        "title": "Stop talking about crude oil prices, please",
        "content": "Most Nigerians have a reasonable idea of what a finance minister’s role entails — managing government finances, overseeing economic policies, regulating financial systems, and more. Yet, one thing that has increasingly worn thin is finance ministers constantly blaming crude oil prices for Nigeria’s economic woes. It’s unproductive, and frankly, it should stop.\n\nIs it an excuse for bad economic management? Thoughtless rhetoric? Whatever it is, it no longer holds water. We *did* squander the crude oil boom (yes, there really was one), and no modern economy can sustainably rely on crude oil revenue anymore. So why keep harping on that tired talking point?\n\nA good Nigerian finance minister should focus on creating and enabling wealth by working with regional commissioners, harnessing the diverse natural and economic strengths of our geo-political zones. The golden era of the 1960s shows what’s possible. For instance, the University of Ife was funded largely by Obafemi Awolowo’s agricultural scheme centered on cocoa farming. That blueprint of leveraging local resources for socio-economic growth is one we need to revisit today.\n\nHere’s a rundown of priorities any competent Nigerian finance minister should embrace:\n\n- Consistently and equitably fund healthcare — we need leaders with courage and intellect to revamp our fragile system.\n- Avoid policies that disproportionately hurt the poor, children, and marginalized groups.\n- Exploit abundant rainfall for agriculture — it’s time to create a socio-economic system that thrives on our natural blessings.\n- Explore sustainable mining of natural resources like gold and bitumen.\n- Manage production deficits so Nigeria produces more than it consumes.\n- Ensure transparent remittance of government funds, despite the difficulty.\n- Collaborate with innovative stakeholders to drive industrial growth and competitiveness.\n- Manage the rising debt profile responsibly.\n- Improve service delivery, especially transportation and education, which directly affect economic output.\n- Reduce waste, such as drastic cuts in legislators’ income.\n- Formulate policies to attract foreign investment and improve remittance channels for Nigerians abroad.\n\nOf course, systemic issues like civil service collapse, insecurity, judicial corruption, and impunity make these goals hard to achieve. Still, it’s less frustrating than listening to finance ministers blame crude oil prices every interview.\n\nAs these discussions go, I am fully aware this is wishful thinking. Next interview, the finance minister will likely again blame crude oil prices. I will grit my teeth, roll my eyes, curse out loud — then pray sincerely: 'Lord send us another smart one. A real smart one.' Amen.",

        "title": "Tackling Nigeria’s needless water crisis",
        "content": "Nigeria is blessed with abundant rainfall and diverse water sources — surface waters, rainwater, shallow and deep groundwater, and even wastewater. Yet, we recklessly overexploit groundwater, often with harmful consequences.\n\nGroundwater overuse leads to drying springs, declining water tables, pollution risks, land subsidence, and biodiversity loss. Moreover, untreated wastewater and polluted water sources pose serious public health risks.\n\nOur chaotic infrastructure means many households rely on individual boreholes, with no central water utilities, which worsens these problems. We must begin allotting water resources based on use: groundwater primarily for drinking, while other sources like surface water and treated wastewater can serve irrigation, cleaning, and industrial needs.\n\nTo tackle this, Nigeria should:\n\n- Develop clear water quality standards by use, inspired by successful models like South Africa.\n- Implement rainwater harvesting programs like Mexico City’s, including filtration and purification for household use.\n- Improve storage in reservoirs, detention ponds, and wetlands to boost supply and preserve the environment.\n- Invest in safe, eco-friendly wastewater recycling for agriculture and other uses.\n- Empower local governments to lead water management with zoning policies and community-specific regulations.\n- Establish reliable pollution monitoring systems and transparent data sharing.\n- Encourage collaboration among government, private sector, environmentalists, scientists, and NGOs to fund and innovate water resource management.\n\nWater management is complex and local, requiring local solutions. Without urgent action and investment, this critical resource will become scarcer.\n\nWater might no longer be infinite — it’s time we start respecting that.",

        "title": "Potential of sustainable sugarcane agriculture in Nigeria",
        "content": "The unsustainability of energy generation using fossil fuels together with the impetus to ensure energy security and the parallel need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are driving a global shift towards biofuels and other so-called renewable energy sources such as solar and wind. Biofuels currently account for 2.5% of transport fuels globally, with an increase to 4% expected by 2035.\n\nBiofuels are generated using contemporary biological processes predominantly agriculture either by utilizing energy crops or indirectly from municipal or agricultural wastes. Sugarcane, an important industrial crop, the raw material for sugar production, certain fermented products and various kinds of medicines has been demonstrated to be a useful raw material in biofuel production. In various parts of the world; Southern Africa, Thailand, India, Pakistan, Latin America especially Brazil, sugarcane is being commercially exploited for biofuels. Sugarcane is a tropical plant and therefore thrives in Nigeria where the climatic and geographical conditions are optimal for cultivation.\n\nGiven the right infrastructure, industrial and political attention, Nigeria can exploit this venture to alleviate its chronic energy crisis and contribute to sustainable socio-economic development. Experts have raised concerns regarding the sustainability of biofuel production using sugarcane as raw material, citing likely impacts on agricultural land use and water resources, food security, biodiversity, ecosystem health, livelihoods as well as other ecological and socio-economic impacts.\n\nOther pundits have posited arguments that increased utilization of biofuels does not necessarily translate to significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. While scientific data suggests that these concerns are indeed legitimate, in my opinion, the potential infrastructural and economic benefits far outweigh the environmental risks. In addition, studies have shown that if properly managed, risks to environmental resources can be minimal. In practice, bioethanol production using sugarcane creates minimal waste, as byproducts are recyclable. For example, some wastes can serve as fertilizer, while others can be used to produce biogas or for irrigation. Brazil, which is the second largest producer of ethanol and the largest producer of sugarcane ethanol (28 billion litres in 2013), globally has become a textbook example of sugarcane agriculture.\n\nAccording to the Brazilian Sugarcane Industry Association (UNICA), as of 2017, Brazil uses at least 40% less petroleum than previously as more than 50% of cars now use biofuel. Currently, 45% of Brazil’s energy comes from renewable sources and about 90% of contemporary Brazilian vehicles have flex-fuel engines, which work using any combination of gasoline and sugarcane ethanol. This has led to a reduction in the Country’s CO2 emissions by at least 600 million tons since the 1970s. In addition, it has burnished the Country’s GDP and boosted trade and socio-economic outlook in many areas.\n\nSugarcane could serve as a major source of industrial raw material/export, create employment, and develop rural economy in Nigeria. Although good medical science evidence indicates that excessive sugar consumption can induce deleterious health effects, sugar continues to be an important raw material for many multinational food companies. Investment in sugarcane agriculture will therefore, serve as a source of industrial sugar and export. In addition, successful commercialization of sugarcane bioethanol can decrease Nigeria’s use and import of fossil fuels, contributing significantly to National development.\n\nSugarcane agriculture should therefore, be included in Nigeria’s development agenda. It should however be approached carefully and constructively. It is important to note that choices in terms of cultivation, geography and technology have a direct impact on the sustainability of this endeavor. The overall most important goals include poverty reduction, decent work, economic growth and improvement of rural livelihoods. The design of the prototype should be such that human rights are protected, that adopted technology ensures proper training of workers, which would introduce more skilled workers into the workforce. In addition, adoption of proper waste management and other ecofriendly farming/production practices must be enforced. Policies that will maintain or even improve ecosystem services associated with sugarcane cultivation areas should be initiated. If successfully established, there are bound to be profound economic benefits and it is therefore, necessary to ensure even distribution of benefits to avoid strife in future.\n\nIt is important to note that this is a capital-intensive endeavor, which requires useful public-private partnerships to generate requisite funds. Nigeria has to become attractive for foreign investment and the need to tackle insecurity-which cannot be overstated, is an important first line of action. There is limited scientific data on sugarcane biology relating to its bioenergy potential, research is therefore, necessary to inform policies, business decisions and schemes. Although it is possible to transfer knowledge, expertise or scientific output from other countries, it is better to conduct research that address local peculiarities. It is also noteworthy that laboratory scale experimentation or generic field trials will be insufficient and so pragmatic industrial trials are necessary before the full-scale adoption of protocols or business models.\n\nFor example, sugarcane varieties that are more water efficient, yield higher fermentable sugars and fibre, and are amenable to mechanical harvesting are now in use in some parts of the world, but their adaptation to the Nigerian climate and how this affects yield is a different matter. This is just one of many other considerations, which is why the appropriate tools and expertise should be employed. The socio-economic potential of sustainable sugarcane agriculture is profound and should be harnessed by decision makers and all other relevant stakeholders.",

        "title": "How Nigeria can mitigate the growing threat of Non Communicable Diseases (NCDs)",
        "content": "The precipitous surge in non-communicable diseases (NCDs) (cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes and chronic respiratory diseases) in Nigeria is highlighting the pathetic state of our healthcare system. Nigeria’s health institutions have failed miserably, such that any tangible repair is expected to take quite some time. The rotten state of affairs, and the urgent need to refurbish physical, preventive, curative, rehabilitative, diagnostic and research infrastructure is widely recognized.\n\nTo strengthen Nigeria’s capacity to respond to the growing threat of NCDs however, certain fundamentals need to be addressed. First, is the alarming exodus of Nigerian trained doctors to foreign Countries. Few weeks ago, a Professor related his difficulty in seeing a medical doctor for a routine physical examination.\n\nAccording to him, it took him a full year to secure an appointment to see a medical doctor at a top government hospital in Ibadan. Now, this is a Professor; an educated, privileged member of the society. Considering his experience, what are the odds that poor Nigerians can access good medical care in reputable hospitals? Due to the general poor sanitation of hospitals, tiresome queues, daunting paperwork, overall gruesome administrative procedures and costs, many Nigerians are discouraged to go to the hospitals except in the case of emergencies.\n\nIt is however, common to get to Nigerian hospitals in the case of an emergency and find that, for whatever reasons, there are no doctors available. It is important to highlight that for many non-communicable diseases, prompt diagnosis and early treatment is critical for survival/full recuperation. If you cannot see a medical doctor promptly, what are the chances of receiving treatment, timely recovery and getting on with life? There are at least 25 medical schools in Nigeria, some of which graduate over 60 doctors, yearly. Somehow, despite such throughput, Nigerians have no convenient access to professional and affordable medical care.\n\nThe second but equally important issue is medical quackery. Organized and non-organized quackery is rife in many parts of the Country. While many private outfits provide impressive health care services, their medical practices are largely unregulated and so, many others for a wide variety of reasons, are a dangerous bane to the Country. Individuals ranging from well trained nurses to auxiliaries and other unlicensed practitioners deliver babies, (mis)manage chronic diseases such as high blood pressure, diabetes and so on in their homes or shops, many times resulting in fatal complications and death. These egregious practices are a direct consequence of the general shortage of doctors and other qualified healthcare professionals, as well as a sad reflection of just how bad things have gotten.\n\nIf we choose to be serious, Nigeria has the capacity to develop appropriate standards and schemes to mitigate these challenges. Obviously, medical intellectual drain has to stop. More political and professional efforts should hence, go into retaining Nigerian doctors. First, many more doctors should be employed by general hospitals. If available public hospitals are already fully staffed, we can build more hospitals. This is not as financially and logistically complicated as many hospital administrators, health directors, political leaders, policy makers and other relevant authorities make it seem. Secondly, doctors’ remuneration should be improved and further financial and professional incentives provided to motivate doctors. It is imperative to ensure proper postgraduate training to effectively squash the need for young doctors to seek better professional training abroad. By many accounts, the residency program in many Nigerian teaching hospitals is thoroughly flawed, yielding frustrating results on all fronts. Specialists should focus on reforming medical postgraduate training systematically and institutionally. Also, it is necessary to create conducive working conditions for doctors, and this can be achieved by boosting infrastructure and creating overall conditions that let doctors treat patients more effectively.\n\nTo tackle quackery, it is important to ensure affordable quality healthcare at all levels, provide routine support for well-trained health workers in remote areas and enlighten Nigerians about the dangers of exposure to sub-standard medical care. Improved surveillance to identify defaulters and conscientious implementation of appropriate sanctions when necessary is another important approach. Enforcement of professional ethical statutes and efficient regulation of medical practice to prevent negligence and malpractices in whatever form is extremely important.\n\nWe need sustainable, cost-effective, culturally sensitive and evidence based interventions. It is therefore, necessary to boost research into the general causes, risk factors, management and prevention of chronic diseases in Nigeria. Strategic and effectively implemented funding for medical and pharmaceutical innovation is necessary. Due to variations in genetic predispositions, diet, socio-economic, lifestyle and environmental factors, it is imprudent to transfer knowledge from advanced nations. It is also necessary to generate data on the economic and social implications of the rising incidence of NCDs across all socio-economic groups in Nigeria. The output of such endeavors should inform the design of a national framework for the prevention and control of NCDs. The most important targets to develop long-term stamina against the health, economic and developmental impact of NCDs, are to strengthen the country’s healthcare system, generate useful local data for medical practice, and empower citizens- by creating awareness and making research output public to inspire behavioral changes that can yield health benefits. Subsequently, we could develop multi- stakeholder partnerships regionally and internationally to consolidate our defense against the scourge of NCDs.",

Their expressions evoke the immense physical and emotional pain, trauma, hunger, and loss they must have endured, including the loss of family and home.\n\nAlthough the war appears to have ended and the area seems calm, these boys face an uncertain and challenging future. Questions arise: Did they receive education or rehabilitation? Who now cares for them? These thoughts bring great concern. This is photojournalism at its most powerful, reminding us to remember all victims of war—boys, girls, women, and men enduring unimaginable suffering.\n\nIt is my hope that world leaders, especially in Africa, will set aside pride and conflicts to work toward lasting peace.

        "content": "It is common for many Nigerians to assume that foreign things are superior and trendy, but this belief is baseless and harmful. This mindset has deeply affected families and society, evident in the widespread adoption of European, especially English, names. While everyone has the right to name their children as they wish, I personally prefer indigenous names and am grateful for my Yoruba names, which carry meaningful cultural significance. \n\nResearch shows that foreign names may contribute to identity confusion, but this is not a focus here. What is critical, however, is the discouragement of speaking native languages at home, which is destructive. Psycholinguists have demonstrated that lack of first language skills can hinder cognitive and academic development and social behavior. Moreover, a strong grasp of a mother tongue improves learning of second languages. Despite this, many parents discourage vernacular languages, robbing children of their identity and cultural heritage.\n\nI have encountered adults who view Yoruba as primitive and refuse to speak it even informally, sometimes responding in English with disapproval when spoken to in Yoruba. I consider bilingualism a great advantage, supported by research. Many who reject their native languages still speak Pidgin English, a creole widely used in Nigeria for communication across ethnic groups. Although Pidgin aids interaction, its constant use, especially among students, harms English vocabulary quality.\n\nIt is crucial for Nigerians to understand and nurture their mother tongues and encourage the younger generation to do the same for cultural preservation and cognitive benefits.",

        "content": "To my utter dismay, Nigerians have continued to bemoan the recent ‘push against globalization’. So many people have been griping about how resentful, hateful, intolerant, discriminatory and racist the developed world has become. While I understand that the Brexit and Trump phenomena are borne out of other factors, in addition to immigration issues, I am focusing on Nigerians’ reaction to the situation.\n\nBefore I continue, I enjoin the reader to please check the meaning of ‘Independence’. It will be helpful to understand that at some point, our leaders agitated for independence from our colonial masters, and this was negotiated and granted. In the ensuing years however, it has become evident that we are thoroughly incapable of managing ourselves. Fifty-six years is such a long time.., and in all this time, we are yet to develop necessary infrastructure, functioning systems and institutions, as well as other elements required to make a nation. Since the country is practically dysfunctional, Nigerian citizens are strewn all over the World, attempting to make the best of their lives.\n\nRegardless of how we spin this, here is a salient point: Nigerians have no right to be upset about the current ‘hostile’ situation. The reason is simple; Our situation is dismal and the environment is not enabling, hence, in order to be productive, there (may be) a need to relocate to better locations that can provide the required facilities for productivity. However, we must take responsibility for our collective misfortune. We must not assume that civilized people are bound /obligated in any way, to be responsible for us. If these people choose to be gracious about our continuous dependence and retardedness, nice! If they choose not to be magnanimous about our fate, please we cannot blame them.\n\nThey were not created to fend for us and pick up our loose ends infinitely. Certainly, Nigerians have proven to be very productive immigrants in many parts of the world participating constructively in commerce, research, academia, et cetera; contributing significantly to growth and development in the Countries they have chosen to reside. This is however, not the crux of the matter, the issue here is that you cannot blame the indigenous citizens for being wary of the massive influx of Nigerians and other foreigners into their home country. We should also remember that while there are many productive Nigerians, there are some others who have proven to be liabilities to these systems. Do we really expect that civilized people will be comfortable watching people come in, overstretch their resources, contaminate their civilization, attempt to skew their heritage and even threaten to out- populate them, and not be even slightly uncomfortable? Let me remind us that this sort of reaction is not that strange after all..I know that many Nigerians remember the ‘Ghana-must-go’ movement.\n\nWe are not superior human beings in this regard. And although people continue to rant about the benefits the developed world continue to enjoy from Nigeria, I do not see the point at all. There are no legit benefits that I can pin point. We continue to be the recipients of all kinds of aids; healthcare (to combat HIV/AIDs, Polio and numerous other diseases), educational incentives, social and environmental benefits amongst others. I need to know how Nigeria is a benefactor of the West! Our citizens continue to live in poverty, frustration and hopelessness and many die of preventable diseases. These features do not strike me as stellar in any way. I wish to implore all disgruntled Nigerians, to divert their venom to their leaders not the people who are now perceived to be intolerant.\n\nIt is time for us to begin to insist on accountability, on quality leadership, on leadership that tirelessly works to stimulate and retain our strongest resource-the people. We must now fight to make our country great indeed. We must agitate for political cleansing and reform and collectively resist Faustian, myopic, visionless political leaders.",

        "title": "A Reminder of the Need for Quality, Accessible Healthcare for All Nigerians",
        "content": "On October 25, 2018, UN member countries unanimously agreed to the Declaration of Astana, a reaffirmation of the landmark Alma-Ata edict promulgated to strengthen primary health care systems globally. The Alma-Ata decree was in 1978, shortly after which Prof. Olikoye Ransome-Kuti became Nigeria’s health minister. During his tenure, Nigeria’s health care system received significant boost, making it a model for several African countries and other parts of the global south. While some critics may disagree, the current rotten state of our health sector effectuated by knaves and reprobates makes Prof. Ransome-Kuti’s health care system despite its flaws, oh so desirable at this point.\n\nIt is November 2018, and we all know that Nigeria’s health care system has virtually collapsed. However, to put things in proper perspective particularly for those who might for whatever reason be disillusioned, it is necessary to provide a few facts for reckoning. According to certain reports, Nigeria provides healthcare for only about 3% of its population with millions lacking access to essential health services. There is a high, albeit poorly documented prevalence of infectious and non-communicable diseases, high maternal/infant mortality rates, malnutrition and general low life expectancy (45 years for men and 49 years for women). Some infectious diseases that have been vanquished in other parts of the world are still endemic in Nigeria.\n\nFor instance, Nigeria is one of three Countries-Afghanistan and Pakistan still grappling with Polio.\nNigeria is reportedly the fourth most dangerous country in the world to give birth, ahead of only Sierra Leone, Central African Republic and Chad. Poor public health response, poor hygiene, inadequate safe water provisions, weak infrastructure, poor record keeping, insufficient personnel are some of the other problems plaguing the system. The country practically has no systems for disease prevention, public health enlightenment, mental, sexual and reproductive health. As a result, many Nigerians die or are rendered morbid from preventable causes.\n\nThe essence of the Astana conference is simple- to reinforce the need for efficient primary health care globally. The participants very likely gleaned important lessons from attendance. Who were these participants and can it be taken for granted that they have the inclination or proper understanding of what it takes to translate this agreement into meaningful growth? More importantly, do they have a work plan or strategy? Are they committed to influencing change in the health sector? Admittedly, revamping Nigeria’s healthcare sector is an arduous task. There are however, simple, pragmatic steps that can be taken to realize these goals. Political will is necessary as every determinant; ranging from critical appointments, infrastructural development, capacity building, to enacting policies is hinged on political decisions. In its absence however, it can be stimulated. It might be a little late in time to talk about electing visionary leaders. However, we have seen how social media activism has influenced political decisions in recent time, even in certain cases where the outrage was misguided. Nigerians should therefore, be enlightened and encouraged to engage with and advocate for achieving the goals stipulated in Astana.\n\nWe need to prepare to task the next President to seek a reformer, in the ilk of Ransome-Kuti who will make bold political choices for health across the entire country, rather than a vacillating, inept Professor with ‘glowing’ credentials. Other activists, academics, philantropists, members of press, patient advocates and health workers must not forget this commitment. The obligations of the government, ministry of health and other relevant authorities or partners are clear. If these stakeholders have lost sight of these, patriotic experts need to update them periodically. These experts can disseminate sound information on social or other media platforms so everyone can be aware and propagate the information.\n\nThe need to empower individuals and communities cannot be overstated. The country has to prioritize the welfare and continued training of medical doctors and other healthcare workers. Nigerian trained medical doctors leave the country in droves and no one seems to care. This is the worst form of brain drain considering the resources that goes into training these doctors. Other sane countries want to retain their talent, not flush them out. These doctors are needed to serve the country particularly the rural areas. With the right incentives, working conditions and career development opportunities, it can be expected that many more doctors will be encouraged to stay. Adequate funding for medical research, equipment and other amenities, bookkeeping and disease prevention schemes is necessary.\n\nIn addition, the country’s health insurance program needs to be improved. Countries like Kenya with laudable initiatives such as National Hospitals Insurance Fund designed to ensure health care for the impoverished may be emulated. We need national, state and local policies, as well as workable strategies to develop and maintain sustainable healthcare systems throughout the country. These policies should ensure accessibility to quality healthcare, improve the health, overall wellbeing and longevity of Nigerians, while contributing meaningfully to the sustainable development of the country.",

        "content": "These past few weeks, I have carefully observed commentary about the recent Afrophobic attacks in Johannesburg and Pretoria, including several excellent pieces published by different reputable media outfits. It might be true that improving the socio-economic circumstances of disgruntled South Africans may ease tensions and prevent future outbursts, but that in my opinion, is not the point at all. Also, while the outburst did not target Nigerians in particular, I will like to clarify here, that the rest of this essay focuses on what Nigeria should do to protect her citizens from future humiliation and brutality.\n\nNigeria now exports its very best talents and lays its citizens bare to the worst forms of exploitation, living as second-class citizens in practically every corner of the world. Many Nigerians living in the diaspora whether they own up to it or not, have to tolerate shabby treatment and even abuse because their Fatherland has become inhabitable. Many in postgraduate programs abroad pay and continue to pay a steep emotional price to acquire already rigorous degrees. Amongst many other potential problems, having to complete a thesis far from your family is very tough. Regardless of work or social status, many Nigerians have to grapple with all manner of social complications, sometimes with lasting impacts on people’s self-perception and or esteem. Even in parts of the world where hostility is not as blatant as it is in South Africa, there is oftentimes a polite, cuddly, and sometimes condescending mien that makes it imperative for some people to go over bounds to prove themselves. Many Nigerians however, just seem to suck it up and forge ahead. Now, I am not saying that living abroad is completely gloomy, no; my main goal is to make a strong case against desperate migration. I also think it is important to make clear, that while I do not think there is any justification whatsoever for brutally attacking other human beings, the phenomenon of hostility towards foreigners is not totally unusual. Might I remind us of the infamous ‘Ghana must go’ agitation? More so, no one is obliged to be compassionate towards you as a Nigerian national in a foreign land; it is just the way it is.\n\nWhether we like it or not, xenophobia in its variants is here to stay, and possibly, for good reason. Look around you; does the recent advancement of Boris Johnson, Marine Le Pen, Donald J Trump, Viktor Urban and Matteo Salvini not indicate something? This sustained popularization of what some have termed ‘extreme right winged’ sentiments is a real reason to pay attention. By the way, for the record, I like Boris Johnson and I admire Marine Le Pen very much; be sure about that. But you see, If you think Trump is dreadful, be prepared as a ‘Trumpier’ Trump is in the making. In fact, our pervasive inability to develop and transform our country is going to create a more formidable Trump in various parts of the Western World in the near future. Migration evidently drives recent rhetoric and global political trends, which I think makes it imperative for us to create a new society that will serve as a homeland for the next generation, so that they can stand strong because of our sacrifices. Wherever on the globe you live in as a Nigerian, I think we are at a historical junction, where we must task ourselves on nation building. As long as we are undeveloped, we are justifying racism and hostility (I have made that case in the past, please see here https://daraalegbeleye.com/2019/06/17/make-nigeria-great-now/). We should stop doing that and work to prove ourselves a diverse, yet functional country. If you were incensed (and I know a lot of us were), by the recent violent outburst in South Africa, I hereby urge you to channel your anger towards the right issues; revolving around nation building. The time is now upon us and we have a lot of work to do.\n\nFirst, there is no doubt that our political leaders are very bad. Actually, without meaning to be vitriolic, I consider them a shameless, inept and monstrous bunch, in every sense of it. I have wondered over the last several weeks, just how these people can live with themselves, seeing the horrific treatment the people they govern have been subjected to. Nigerian Leaders (former and current) are horrid, no doubt, but many of us have been complicit and even conspiratorial in creating this dystopian Nigeria. Whether by sheer carelessness or deliberate intent, we have created this sorry state of affairs and I think it is prudent to set aside blame apportionment, roll up our sleeves and get to work.\n\nForemost, we need a complete overhaul of our political system. While I understand that we are evolving and ours is a young democracy by many standards, our political practices are so bad, that I think in the current form, there is hardly any sort of fine-tuning that can make it more effective. Fundamentally, obtaining funds from mega-donors means that no matter how lofty the ideas or how good the intentions, some bad players will continue to disproportionately influence political and economic decisions. One potential solution is to expand government and provide more support for politicians, although, this is likely to be a hard sell as practically every player is perceived to be corrupt. I have in the past, described how citizens can better finance or participate in local and national politics as well as other approaches to improve our political practices. You may see https://daraalegbeleye.com/2019/09/17/citizens-as-agents-of-change/ for details.  I also recommend that we all familiarize ourselves with our electoral laws; the stipulations as well as limitations and monitor enforcement closely. Elections in Nigeria are insanely expensive and the government must put a strict limit on how much money can be expended on election campaigns. Further, we need to create a political climate that would force parties and candidates to actually compete in the arena of platform and policy. We must insist on decisive, comprehensive agendas, rather than continuing to adopt the cloak and dagger, lesser of two evils and other fear based tactics that compel people to vote for candidates who do not represent their inclinations/interests adequately.\n\nIn addition and possibly more importantly, Nigerians need to be properly educated on traits and qualities to watch out for in potential candidates. It is good to avoid bloviating suave individuals who demonstrate gross ineptitude on key policy issues. Governance is not about being a motivational speaker, corporate lobbyist, or any of that, no. A good presidential or governorship candidate must have a clear plan on how to solve specific problems. There must be an emphasis on effective solutions, smart prioritization, competence and integrity. The candidate must demonstrate a level of kindness and must appreciate the human right for people to live decently. He/she must provide a realistic framework for providing the essentials of life, which include power, safe water, healthcare, education and sewage service. The candidate must demonstrate how his/her government will invest in citizens, generally, but more specifically provide meaningful jobs that will instill dignity and pride in people. This, according to documented best practices in advanced countries and sound economic research, has great potential to not only boost the socio-economic wellbeing of citizens, but tackle deep-rooted vices including crime, substance abuse and prostitution. I also suggest that we adopt an approach where presidential candidates prior to elections, identify capable hands to fill ministerial positions, who will with clear-eyed precision articulate policies and implement economic fundamentals that will improve our lives. These individuals should be screened alongside the main candidates.\n\nAs voters, we have to make conscientious efforts to avoid the ballyhoo that typically accompanies mildly impressive political performance that should ideally be the norm. We deserve more and should persistently demand for more. We can also task our elected officials on electoral promises and protest against flagrant negligence or other forms of misconduct, poor governance or political corruption. There is safety in numbers in relation to protesting and we must learn to peacefully, but resolutely hit the streets from time to time.\n\nI have nothing whatsoever against old leaders, but it is crucial that my generation sifts young leaders with the same authoritarian and exploitative legacies of our predecessors from the flock and make a point of keeping them out of electoral office. This is arguably, the most difficult task and I hope to provide workable strategies on how to achieve this in a future article. It is also important to move away from ‘Politics by insult’, which is now so rampant, with some chief players who seem to lack tact playing Mr Shtick. That has so far not proven helpful and is frankly, not constructive. These by my assessment, are the short-term priorities. In the long haul, we should pay attention to how candidates can improve infrastructure, good capacity in science and technology, revitalize our withered institutions and develop sustainable schemes for initiating and adopting scientifically informed policies. Poverty eradication, which can be attained if we are serious, is key to achieving any tangible goals. Poor people will continue to vote for the wrong candidates, because of all the wrong motivations. Overall, we must be consistent and tenacious, as things will not dramatically change in four or even ten or twenty years. It will likely take a very long time, but we should start now.\n\nApart from reordering our political practices, we will not achieve much with a morally and ethically bankrupt judicial system, as a functional judiciary is symbolic to the health of the entire system. Therefore, we need an independent, transparent and efficient judicial system such that all segments of our society can be confident in the administration of justice. Like our civil and public service, there are some rotten players in our judicial system that we must find a way to be rid of. The judiciary is also overworked, and there is a need to appoint more judges to enable cases move faster. Improved funding and technological innovation are also necessary to enhance efficiency. Lastly, all of us, but more importantly the experts need to correctly understand the rules that constitute our laws and agitate for amendments, where necessary.\n\nIt is undeniable that government action and lead is crucial, but every one of us at all levels, in public, private and voluntary sectors have a responsibility to ensure that we furnish the much-desired change. For those who are employed in any capacity, we can try to do our jobs more conscientiously. There is the morally urgent issue of government officials stealing public funds. I wish to suggest that henceforth, before misappropriating funds, you should consider your children and grandchildren. Think about how rewarding it will be for them to live in a country with fantastic healthcare, education, and social infrastructure. I believe that is more fulfilling than whatever current gain you may derive from mismanaging public resources today. Focus on that and do not divert funds. Cast your vote wisely, make a point to be orderly in traffic and queues, dispose of your waste like a decent person and as much as possible, just try to be civilized. Promote meritocracy by offering the most qualified candidate a position. I am not saying I am perfect myself, but before doing anything nowadays, I think about the quality of Nigeria that I will be leaving behind for my lovely niece, nephew and god-children and I encourage you to do the same. Focus on your children, so that the likelihood of anyone getting burned alive outside Nigeria becomes considerably minimal. Finally, it is prudent for us all to mentally prepare for political and socio-cultural grift and we should thus, be ready to set aside our seemingly rife virtue signaling, moral narcissism and pedant tendencies. As a people, we have to tolerate opposing notions, give in to superior arguments, and be ready to make pragmatic compromise, where necessary. I am aware of the general sense of hopelessness among Nigerians, but we can create a truly great Country. Actually, we have to make a strong resolve to try.",

        "content": "Despite good empirical evidence demonstrating the perils of basing policy on untested ideas, our Government continue to initiate and implement shallow, obnoxious and thoroughly flawed policies. Some recently enacted policies are more disruptive and horrid than others, but I have found myself persistently wondering: what exactly is the how of the formulation of these pea brained policies? While I am very optimistic, I am fully aware that our political Leaders are not capable of any critical thinking. It is becoming increasingly clear even to the most idealistic people that otherwise commonsensical notions require a mighty cerebral effort for a good number of them. The fact that we cannot expect intellectually sound ideas from simpletons ignites a fundamental curiosity: regardless of the intellectual capacity of a Nigerian Politician and his/her strategists, are there any acceptable courses of action or procedures that modulate policy formulation in Nigeria?\n\nI try conscientiously not to restrict my popular writing to my opinion or mere ranting. I endeavor to use data to explore the challenges confronting us as a Nation and evaluate how policy solutions together with constructive civic engagement can contribute meaningfully to our democratization and socioeconomic development. This as you might imagine, requires heavy research and my research is typically not limited to reading but speaking with as many experts as humanly possible.\n\nSo this time around, after going through several hoops and hurdles, I was by sheer providence introduced to a former Government strategist, a now retired Professor of Economics, who was very generous with me and answered all my questions patiently. At some point, during our discussion, he referred me to some relevant academic papers that he and some colleagues had published recently. I was glad, as that would provide the opportunity for me to peruse Figures and Tables, which for me is the most efficient way to understand research output. In a bizarre twist of events however, I discovered that these papers were not available on the internet, leaving me feeling completely flummoxed. I would like to state unambiguously that it is not my intention to criticize this apparently brilliant and decent man, and that invariably, I was able to read the papers (they are available at a University Library).\n\nThis experience, while particularly poignant in this instance, is not unique. Many times, I find myself during the course of research feeling desperately frustrated. Some days I spend hours reading worthless junk reports/commentaries and using every trick possible to attempt to extrapolate linear, consistent relationships between/among variables, predict outcomes or infer meaningful conclusions from what I can only refer to as hack jobs. I thus decided to switch tones and chose to focus instead on what I consider a Gordian knot; data availability and presentation in Nigeria.\n\nThere is a painful dearth of data in Nigeria. It is hard to pin down precise numbers on virtually any subject matter, from security (or shall I say insecurity indeed), public health, trade, agriculture, manufacturing, resource extraction/exploration or technological innovation, police work and other related social issues. All Practitioners, administrators and policy makers need accurate and adequate information to fulfil their professional and societal obligations. It is obvious and I wish I did not have to emphasize this in 2020, but actionable governance is impossible without data!\n\nI should clarify here that ‘data’ in this context does not exclusively mean units or hard numbers, we also have no quantitative social indicators whatsoever. Which begs the question, what drives socio-economic decision making in Nigeria? And what really is the government’s plan to spur the economy? How can we respond appropriately to contemporary threats and challenges with no solid data to adequately characterize our problems? How can we develop operational tactics and strategies in the face of such dire data inadequacies? So evidently, we need better numbers, but how can this be achieved?  \n\nHere a few of my thoughts and I must clarify that they are my thoughts, not backed by any substantial experiential evidence. First, I think we need improved government investment in research. This will require much more than just pumping money into the system. It is necessary to strengthen human capability to conduct good quality research that will be comprehensible by a global audience. Good science is very expensive and we need a consistent positive pattern of political choices to inform locally tailored research. Furthermore, we must develop a transparent, crisp, linear process where all relevant players are conscientious, reform-minded, passionate, fastidious and are open-minded to novel technologies and investigative approaches.\n\nData collection does not have to be limited to academic or structured research; commercial research organizations, the media, think tanks, political organizations, other interest groups, lobbyists and other establishments may use standardized approaches (for example, sample surveys and polls) to not only generate socially relevant data, but periodically assess social attitudes/public opinion. All that matters is that the involved parties are capable of objectively identifying and exploring arguments that illuminate our most urgent developmental issues and generate meaningful data from the process. It is also crucial that such research endeavors differentiate clearly between controversy and consensus. It is important to state here that while I encourage bountiful commercial investments in research or data acquisition, we must be aware of the potential for big money to pervert research and we must vigilantly adopt tactics that will preserve the integrity of the process.\n\nOf the several key relevant Professionals required for the sound acquisition, interpretation, presentation, management and preservation of useful data for Nigeria’s socio-economic development, I want to focus briefly on a critical yet overlooked group of experts: Historians. They are relevant for this process for a wide variety of reasons, but for one, our traditions influence our inclinations and behavior as a people. While I think there are many sound Historians, I believe that it is necessary to mentor contemporary Historians [particularly those who choose relevant specialization(s)] to not only objectively report, analyze and report history, but work to provide an integrated analyses of our social, cultural, political, diplomatic and economic realities.\n\nOverall, we must begin to prioritize empiricism and generate requisite data to properly describe our problems, create estimates, forecasts and developmental policies. Nigeria’s problems are multifaceted, but lack of good data complicates all of them either collectively or separately.\n\nI am still in the process of learning how policies are formulated in Nigeria and in due course, all things being equal, there will be an actual post on field trials of policies.",

        "content": "The unfortunate circumstances that led up to George Floyd’s death elicited outrage throughout the world. George Floyd’s death saddened me deeply, but then, Nigerians started to passionately chant the Black Lives Matter mantra and I became distracted. I have a stiff reflex for online civility; in fact, I often wonder how total strangers can exchange such bitter banter on the internet and always remind myself that I never want to be so unchivalrous.\n\nSo when I started to read Nigerians’ reaction online, I avoided social media religiously because I feared I was going to get into a digital altercation with someone. As with most other things, time can act as an efficient pacifier. Your pain and animosity lingers, but your emotions aren’t as raw or even volatile, and so you have better control of your feelings and are much less prone to potentially catastrophic outbursts.\n\nBut still, Nigerians will not stop talking about this- not George Flyod’s death in itself, but racial discrimination. More pointedly, so many people have written to me asking my opinion about the situation. If I have ignored your prodding/prompt, it’s not because I wanted to be rude, but because as you will now find out, I have a contrary opinion. And while at times, I disagree with people just because I want to be contrarian, frankly, this time, I am confident of the way I feel.\n\nI should clarify here that this essay is directed at disgruntled Nigerians. Not Black-Americans or anyone else. Noone but Nigerians, please take note. Thank you.\n\nSo if you are a Nigerian and you have felt dismissed, intimidated, wronged and so on and so forth in a foreign Country, and you got on that BLM movement, protesting against the US government and authorities, I want you to pay careful attention here. My first question to you is this: Why do you consider yourself, a person from a Country with rich oil reserves, extensive deposits of several marketable natural resources, favorable climate for agriculture, yet astoundingly poor-, why do you think you have the moral and intellectual virtue to tell people in the greatest Country on Earth how to run the show? Just why? Now, I do not support racial injustice in any form and I was particularly excited to see Nigerians complain, but it was grossly misdirected. Do your best to internalize this please: Except the US government invited you to relocate to their Country, I don’t think you should rant. You can either suck it up and live with it or relocate. However, you are not completely helpless or at least you don’t have to be.\n\nTo you, Mr and Ms Grumpy, Isn’t it curious that I should be breaking this to you: Your oppressor isn’t the white Man. No, not at this point, not in 2020. Your oppressors are the men and women who have mortgaged your future and that of your descendants by prodigiously squandering your resources and mismanaging your affairs to the point where nothing at all works.\n\nYour oppressors are those people who were gifted oil wells and then brand themselves as noble, sophisticated role models. You do not protest those people. You adulate them, you even quote them and follow their ‘teachings’, on their birthdays, you shower them with glowing praise and benevolent wishes. You continue to give them audience and platforms to matter. You permit their grandiose self-aggrandizement and laugh at their dead jokes. Its either you are a hypocrite, a clown or just plain gullible! If someone bequeathed you or your father an oil well too, odds are you will be very wealthy. But can’t you see? Even if you follow those ‘teachings’ from now until the next decade, it might not lead to that sort of stupendous wealth. Can you not see that the pipeline to the middle class is now clogged or even downright dislodged? If you cannot see that, you should not continue reading this.\n\nThere is that stanza of our National anthem that goes: ‘Great lofty heights attain, to build a country, where peace and justice shall reign’. Yes, BUILD! You do not want to build, because you are lazy but you can invest your energies into touting a meaningless mantra. And yes, it is meaningless, if you cannot build your country. I have written about nation building in the past and do not care to repeat myself. You may see https://daraalegbeleye.com/2019/10/03/before-the-next-xenophobic-outburst/ and https://daraalegbeleye.com/2019/06/17/make-nigeria-great-now/. Anyone with even something akin to functional brain cells must by now know that racial discrimination is not going anywhere, if we cannot manage ourselves, as Nigerians. You want better treatment? You no longer want to suffer indignities?  More importantly, there is a seemingly good chance that somewhere in the next five to ten generations, one of your descendants will be mistreated, burned alive or somehow mobbed in a foreign Country. I hope that possibility bothers you at least a little and can spur you to emulate better organized systems and build your Country. We have what it takes and as I always say, it will take a very long time, but we must start now. Meanwhile, I encourage you to desist from being a hypocrite.",

        "content": "Of the several conceptual errors plaguing my generation, the complete disregard for quality journalism is irksome. Shall we take a test? If you are reading this and you are aged 25 – 45, please ask your friends and associates if they know of and read/listen to the following seasoned political pundits: Idowu Akinlotan, Sonala Olumhense, Tatalo Alamu, Dr Tony Marinho and Babjide Kolade Otitoju. Indeed, we have many influential thinkers, but I consider these men economic, intellectual and social assets and I think many reform-oriented people will agree with me. They offer brilliant and balanced insights into some of our most biting challenges and illuminate ways to draw up blueprints for our much-desired “new society”. To be clear, I do not always agree with Mr Otitoju, but he is undoubtedly perspicacious, offers contextual explanation, and oftentimes is delightful to watch.\n\nYou may write to tell me what you found, but I doubt the results are positive. For the sake of argument, if I haven’t mentioned someone you consider worthy, I am sure he/she is sound, but the point here is that most young Nigerians are likely unfamiliar with their work. So this isn’t really about the names or my preferences, it’s about our prevalent culture of indifference. \n\nNot only do young Nigerians waste too much time on frivolities like that show everyone was recently raving about, most of us, even those who might qualify as socioeconomically or politically aware pay undue attention to pseudo-intellectuals, who waffle and bluster all the while offering nothing constructive except peddle ridiculous notions and fan misguided debates.  Most of them merely rant, though some take it a step further and inform but they do not advise or offer practical approaches to rehabilitating Nigeria. Some of them outright circulate inferior information.\n\nI must admit that the more important problem is how the majority of young Nigerians find these charlatans, who possibly should be the textbook example of the Dunning Kruger effect appealing. This obtuse taste lends sudden clarity and profound meaning to the saying ‘A people deserve the leadership they get’ and is predictably why we will have a lot of trouble developing. I think the impact of alarming levels of corruption, political and executive incompetence, though critical, will be minimal in comparison with our poor political and social consciousness as a group. Remember that the power of politics is the people.\n\nExcept we intend to become the world republic for entertainment (I am not saying there is anything wrong with that), but a great nation requires innovation and if we want to compete successfully, we need capacity (institutional, physical and human). Already, we are behind on the most critical frontiers of innovation; software and pharmaceuticals, chemical manufacturing, production of communications equipment, data acquisition and processing, semiconductors, aerospace and so forth, despondently grappling with myriad fundamental problems. For context and or emphasis, we still do not have constant electricity supply, in 2020. \n\nOur institutions are crumbling, authorities are perversely corrupt, essential services have been stripped bare, faith in the whole Nigerian experiment is evaporating, yet we are so indifferent; one could liken our attitude to golfing under a volcano.\n\nI am sure we can all agree that for us to move forward we need to understand what is going wrong, which is where we need thought leaders who can catalyze valuable debates and model critical thinking. Most of us are ignorant of economic fundamentals but Economists, political scientists and indeed elected officials and other relevant public servants are going to articulate policies that will affect our lives and the lives of our children. While we do not necessarily need to understand the nitty gritty of political economics, we must not fly blind either.\n\nWe are bearing the painful brunt of past economically illiterate policies, which to me, means that we must all strive to understand the makings of good policy and agitate for what we consider beneficial. We want a functional democracy, vigorous, sustainable industries and institutions, as well as leaders who will pursue technocratically elegant policies that can create jobs and revitalize communities. Yet we seem to be psychologically kicking the can down the road, hoping for some extraordinary intervention. Many of us want Nigeria to be a great place to make a living and to make a life, but creating that Nigeria requires some brave thinking and bold decisions. Brave thinking requires some fuel, the kind you will not get from synaptically challenged, toady individuals.\n\nThere are many experts with differing views and I am not suggesting that only the ideas that command expert consensus are good ideas. Also, I acknowledge the need to respect free will, particularly in these unparalleled times, and so I wish to emphasize that it isn’t my intention to foist my preferences on other people. I therefore, hope you will purposefully screen and select a person/organization that can help you identify the most crucial policy issues and understand the steep political and socioeconomic challenges confronting our Nation.\n\nWhomever you choose, I think you should try to avoid those who rousingly serve you a bunch of generic platitudes and dazzle you with woke sentiments. You don’t want a performer or someone who will impose their own skepticism or personal pathologies on you. By all means, avoid those who willingly mount heresy hunts or validate the authoritarian and exploitative legacies of some sociopolitical factions. You want people who can inspire approaches to knowledge, stimulate positive, constructive habits of mind, and teach political and socioeconomic procedures that will create sustainable, multigenerational improvements.\n\nIf you decide to choose one of the people I have suggested, that’s great. I realize that this endeavor takes time and requires some effort and if you must select one: I recommend Idowu Akinlotan. If you have space for two: Idowu Akinlotan and Sonala Olumhense.  \n\nTo those who consider themselves sophisticated thinkers and merely criticize those who aren’t actively engaging with quality journalism, let me remind you that when civic life becomes degraded, everyone is affected- everyone, including the so-called sophisticated.\n\nI also think that the structured media have a role to play. In the age of all manner of newfangled media, it is easy for many people to become distracted. However, veteran journalists can expertly tell the difference between ersatz journalism and the real thing and I think they have a responsibility to formulate approaches to enlighten or guide the masses.",

        "content": "In Nigeria, dairy products, which are essential sources of nutrients and flavors to various dishes, are a staple in many households. Consumption of unpasteurized dairy products such as but not only fresh or fermented cow’s milk, wara, nono, and kindrimo is however quite common.\n\nPurveyors of this practice argue that raw dairy products have more nutrients and flavors, but the scientific consensus is that the risks associated with consuming unpasteurized dairy far outweigh the potential benefits. Although I appreciate the sentiment that some raw dairy products have cultural significance because of their rich flavors and other desirable properties, potential associated health risks must be taken seriously.\n\nUnlike their pasteurized counterparts, which undergo a process of heating to kill germs, unpasteurized dairy products retain the potential for contamination by pathogens such as E. coli, Salmonella, and Listeria.\n\nIn a country like Nigeria, where food safety standards and enforcement may vary, the risk of contamination in unpasteurized dairy products is significantly higher. Improper handling, storage, and transportation of raw milk can further increase the chances of bacterial growth, putting consumers at risk of foodborne illnesses.\n\nPregnant women, young children, the elderly, and individuals with compromised immune systems are particularly vulnerable to the dangers of consuming unpasteurized dairy products. For them, the consequences of a foodborne illness can be severe and even life-threatening.\n\nIn light of these risks, relevant actors must act decisively. First, it is vital to understand and document the prevalence of this practice. Studies should thus be conducted to quantify the proportion of Nigerians who consume unpasteurized dairy products. To facilitate the formulation and implementation of effective mitigation strategies, studies should also characterise the factors driving the consumption of unpasteurized dairy. It is also important to promote food safety awareness within our communities. This can take the form of media campaigns, community workshops, school programs, local outreaches, and so on.\n\nPasteurization is a proven method to eliminate foodborne pathogens without significantly altering the nutritional value of the milk or dairy product. To protect yourself and your loved ones from the risks associated with unpasteurized dairy products, you should consume pasteurized dairy products only.\n\nLet’s raise awareness (I think everyone can participate or contribute to this), make informed choices, and embrace a culture of food safety in every meal we enjoy.\n\nNotes:\nWara: This is a locally made cheese produced from raw cow’s milk. It is similar to cheese curds and is commonly consumed in Nigeria.\nNono: This is a traditional Nigerian fermented milk product made from raw cow’s milk. It has a slightly sour taste and is often consumed as a beverage or used in cooking.\nKindrimo: This is a type of yogurt made from raw cow’s milk. It is popular in some parts of Nigeria and is consumed as a snack or dessert.",
